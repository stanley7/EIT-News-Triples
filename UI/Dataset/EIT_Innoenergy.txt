ROSI’s recycling process keeps the raw material’s purity high, creating new and locally available secondary raw material sources. ROSI’s recycling plant in Grenoble has proven the recycling process and closed the commercial value chain. Being first of a kind and delivering substantial ESG impact, ROSI plays a crucial role in closing the loop for the PV industry. Success story CorPower Ocean Stabilising the renewable energy supply Wave energy has the potential to ensure a stable, clean electricity supply, but past technologies struggled with durability, cost, and efficiency. With an exploitable potential of up to 1,800 GW, wave energy could provide 10-30% of global electricity consumption. CorPower has developed a storm-resilient wave energy technology that delivers 5 times more electricity per tonne than other solutions and significantly lowers capital and operating costs. Success story SeaQurrent 24/7 clean, time-matched power The global tidal energy market is growing and expected to be around USD 4B by 2033, with a CAGR of 14% from 2026 to 2033. SeaQurrent’s patented multi-wing TidalKite™ system, a groundbreaking technology that ‘3D-harnesses’ energy from tidal and ocean currents, capturing up to 3x more energy than other tidal technologies. SeaQurrent’s TidalKite system has been successfully demonstrated in real-world conditions, with technology development at TRL 7 and permits secured. Success story Hysun 100% clean, off-grid, and cost-competitive green hydrogen Hysun’s unique photo-thermo-catalysis process produces 100% clean hydrogen with zero emissions. Its support for on-off transitions and operating off-grid reduces capex and opex. Targeting the fast-growing green hydrogen market, Hysun provides flexible business models: turnkey delivery and transfer (BOOT) and longterm hydrogen sales (HPA). Hysun is commissioning its R&D prototype and advancing from TRL 4 to TRL 5, focusing on real-world validation and paving the way for industrial deployment and strategic partnerships. Success story Skeleton Technologies 2x higher power density and a 50% smaller footprint Skeleton offers a top-end supercapacitor for the grid based on its patented electrode material, Curved Graphene. The supercapacitor can handle extremely high powers (fast charge/discharge) and last for hundreds of thousands of cycles. As more renewable energy powers the grid, it becomes more sensitive to short disturbances. To mitigate this, Skeleton’s supercapacitor stabilises the grid. Skeleton’s current production is in Estonia and Germany, and further production capacity is being developed in Germany and France.
