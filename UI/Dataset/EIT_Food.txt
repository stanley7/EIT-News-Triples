Home News & updates EWA 2025 North Macedonia - Mastering the Art of the Pitch EWA 2025 North Macedonia - Mastering the Art of the Pitch As part of the EWA 2025 programme, the Masterclass in Skopje helped women entrepreneurs from North Macedonia’s agrifood ecosystem master the art of impactful communication, build investor-ready presentations and gain confidence for public speaking. 05 Nov 2025 EIT Food North & East A two-day Masterclass was held on September 29 and 30 at Public Room in Skopje , organized within the Empowering Women in Agrifood (EWA) programme - developed by EIT Food and implemented locally by the Foundation for Management and Industrial Research (MIR). The masterclass brought together women entrepreneurs from North Macedonia’s agrifood sector, helping them present their innovative business ideas to investors, mentors, and potential partners. Through a dynamic mix of practical workshops, interactive exercises, simulations, and personalized mentoring, participants enhanced their pitching skills and developed the confidence, structure, and clarity needed for persuasive and impactful public speaking. Mastering the Structure and Delivery of a Successful Pitch The main goal of the Masterclass was to help participants develop clear, impactful, and convincing communication for their business ideas. Through a carefully structured programme, the entrepreneurs explored how to define and visualize their Business Model Canvas, understand what attracts investors and makes a business appealing, craft an influential story using storytelling techniques, build confidence and stage presence, and recognize the most common pitching mistakes to avoid. The first day of the training focused on understanding the structure of a successful pitch — analyzing key elements such as the problem, solution, market, business model, team, and investment needs. The second day emphasized practical application, as participants worked individually with mentors, tested their presentations in simulated conditions, and received detailed professional feedback. The sessions were conducted in collaboration with the experienced team from ZAFIR CAPITAL - Gogo Rafajlovski, Natasha Velkovska and Igor Mishevski - who, through a dynamic methodology and real-life examples, guided participants in refining both the content and delivery of their presentations. The MIR team moderated the entire training, fostering an inspiring and supportive environment that encouraged collaboration, knowledge exchange, and networking among participants. During the final part of the masterclass, each participant had the opportunity to deliver a four-minute presentation and receive personalized feedback focused on clarity, communication, structure, and investor appeal. Trainers provided individual advice and practical recommendations, helping participants strengthen their performance and build a recognizable brand behind their ideas. Preparing for the Final Demo Day The session also created valuable networking opportunities with mentors from the EWA programme, encouraging the exchange of experiences and inspiring participants as they prepared for the next EWA event — the final Demo Day, where women entrepreneurs will have the opportunity to present their innovative solutions to an audience of experts, investors, and potential business partners. With initiatives like this, the EWA – Empowering Women in Agrifood programme, supported by EIT Food and implemented by MIR , continues to cultivate a vibrant community of women innovators in the agrifood sector, nurture their entrepreneurial spirit, and create meaningful opportunities for sustainable growth and development. About Foundation for Management and Industrial Research MIR is a dynamic organization driving economic development, innovation, and sustainability.

Home News & updates From Finance to Storytelling: Portuguese EWA Mentees Advance Their Agrifood Ventures From Finance to Storytelling: Portuguese EWA Mentees Advance Their Agrifood Ventures The Portuguese edition of the Empowering Women in Agrifood (EWA) programme brought together participants for a day dedicated to financial management, storytelling and innovation in agrifood. 03 Nov 2025 EIT Food South As part of the Empowering Women in Agrifood (EWA) initiative led by EIT Food , the Portuguese mentees gathered on 20 October for an in-person Masterclass designed to strengthen their entrepreneurial and technical skills. The event was organised by BGI Sustainable Ventures , the local implementing partner of EWA in Portugal, and offered a day of learning, exchange and collaboration for all participants in the 2025 cohort. The day opened with a session on Financial Management and Planning, led by Nadine Teles (MINDshift Skills Hub), who shared practical strategies for building strong, sustainable business foundations. This was followed by an engaging Pitching and Storytelling workshop with Clara Gameiro Pais ( BGI Sustainable Ventures ), which focused on helping entrepreneurs communicate their ideas with clarity, confidence and impact. In the afternoon, Joana Cruz ( Food4Sustainability CoLAB ) introduced participants to the topic “The Soil Microbiome at the Service of the Agrifood Industry” , offering a scientific perspective on innovation and sustainability. The group also visited ArrudaLab , where research and entrepreneurship meet, gaining valuable insights into applied innovation in the agrifood ecosystem. To conclude the day, the mentees dedicated time to refining and rehearsing their pitches, preparing for the EWA Portugal Final, which will take place on 24 November 2025. The Masterclass served as an important milestone in the EWA journey, blending business development, scientific insight and peer learning to empower women to lead change in Portugal’s agrifood sector. Meet the 2025 EWA entrepreneurs in Portugal: This year’s cohort brings together ten innovative women working across diverse areas of the agrifood sector, from circular economy and biotechnology to digital tools and sustainable nutrition. Their ventures aim to reduce waste, improve food systems, and foster more conscious consumption. Below is an overview of the projects they will develop over the course of the programme: Ana Pires is developing PackWAI, an accessible and intuitive solution to optimize the development of biodegradable/compostable packaging, promoting circular economy and sustainability in the food sector. Ítala Marx leads VIDA , a project that transforms by-products from the agri-food industry, such as olive pomace, into high-value functional ingredients, fostering health, sustainability, and the circular economy. Viviana Ribeiro is working on AgriDerma , a project that develops an innovative dermal matrix from agri-food industry by-products, offering an ethical and sustainable alternative for laboratory testing and biomedical applications. Ana Vilas-Boas is developing BioUpCycle , a venture that transforms agrifood waste into high-value biostimulants and culture media, contributing to more regenerative and sustainable agriculture. Paula Galvanini founded MAI Fermentation House , a platform that promotes autonomy in the production of healthy and sustainable fermented foods at home. Through hands-on workshops and DIY kits, she empowers consumers to care for their gut health while reducing reliance on industrial food systems. The project also offers ready-to-eat fermented foods from small local producers. Maria Antunes is building Nula , a digital platform that combines an online school and a food assistant, supporting users through every stage of their food journey, from shopping to repurposing leftovers, promoting sustainability with every bite. Mariana Fortes runs Pegada Distinta by Pluralgae , a project that develops food and beverage products enriched with spirulina. Her work combines innovation in nutrition with low environmental impact, offering accessible, sustainable alternatives to conventional protein sources. Inês Luís is developing Susplus , a transformative and simple digital platform designed with and for SMEs. It converts a seamless flow of value chain data into actionable and collaborative decarbonisation strategies. We are the missing link connecting small businesses and large companies through data and projects, driving climate action. Ana Cristina Vítor leads RumiPep , developing a functional feed additive for ruminants using antimicrobial peptides from industry by-products to improve animal health and reduce antibiotics use.

Home News & updates Confidence in the making: Bojan’s journey with AMPLE Velika Plana Confidence in the making: Bojan’s journey with AMPLE Velika Plana As part of AMPLE Velika Plana, participants learned practical skills in washing, cutting, drying and creating tomato-based products - turning seasonal produce into something that tastes like home. 03 Nov 2025 EIT Food North & East Behind every jar and every dried slice is a story of support, togetherness and new beginnings. This is Bojan’s. Can you briefly introduce yourself — who are you and what do you do in your daily life? My name is Bojan. I come from Krnjevo, a small town near Velika Plana. For many years I have been a member of the “Will for Life” Association because of my disability. I have a long-term girlfriend and I am currently looking for a permanent job to secure a more stable future for myself. Thinking back to your first activities on the project, what do you remember and how did you feel? I was excited. They called me and asked if I wanted to participate in the workshops. Of course I agreed. I saw some familiar faces and felt comfortable. Which sessions or activities were your favourites, and why? I liked everything. The workshops were fun. It was hard work, but with good company and a nice atmosphere, everything was easier. If something wasn’t clear, we asked. The business lectures were also fun. Was there a standout moment - or a smell, taste, or person - you still remember? The training when we had the opportunity to taste several types of tomatoes. I didn’t even know how many varieties existed, and then I had the chance to hear about them, see them and taste them. Also, the taste of dried tomatoes. I was proud of the first successful round of dried tomatoes. It was delicious. Did you gain new friendships or perhaps new inspiration for the future through the training? I made a couple of good friends that I will keep in touch with. After these workshops, I got a strong desire to continue doing this or a similar job because I think I did very well, learned a lot and see myself in a job related to production in the future. How has participating in the AMPLE Velika Plana program changed your daily life or way of thinking? I acquired a work habit! I had the obligation to come to the workshops and give my best. I socialised with other participants. The whole summer I had a preoccupation and changed my daily routine, which I liked a lot. I have created a CV and am actively looking for a job in the food sector, because I now have the confidence to do it.

Home Our Missions Net Zero Food System Net Zero Food System We will enable the transition to a net zero food system, measuring and quantifying the change through reduced CO2 equivalent emissions. Find out about our Impact Funding Framework The food system is responsible for almost a third of greenhouse gas emissions, with connected challenges such as food waste, resource depletion and energy consumption. To reach net zero and mitigate the impacts of the climate crisis, we must scale a systems approach to change that enables the transition to sustainable and regenerative agriculture practices, creates new markets and opportunities for food waste and loss reduction, and empowers all stakeholders to play an active role in the circular food economy. EIT Food's Net Zero Food System mission framework is based on three targets where the EIT Food community can have the most impact, and in the areas of greatest need. These are: Establishing regenerative agriculture as a commercially viable option in key value chain Reducing food loss and waste Growing the circular food economy through packaging and labelling. This is reflected in our community building and advocacy activities and underpins the design of our funding and partnership opportunities. Read the Mission Fact Sheet Net Zero Food System insight report EIT Food has published a Net Zero Food System Insight report, co-designed and authored by a community of experts and organisations committed to driving change in this Mission area. This report describes the agrifood systems change we all need to see to improve the environmental of our food system. The transformation needed is more action than any one organisation is capable of by itself. Download the Report Deep dive into our research on creating a net zero food system, and the actions we recommend Real progress towards a net zero food system requires radical food systems transformation so that food produced in a sustainable, equitable and affordable way is available to all people. To achieve this, key enablers of change include the integration of data into all value chain measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) processes, the overcoming of barriers to behaviour change in the farming community, and a change in consumer behaviour. Key findings Agriculture and primary production Beef production, rice production and feed coming from deforested areas have the most negative effect on the emissions of greenhouse has (GHG). Some innovation is required here, but enabling farmers to lead the transition is the key, including ensuring their understanding and overcoming barriers to adoption. This includes the critical need for standardised MRV and definitions for Net Zero and Regenerative Agriculture. Food loss and food waste Measuring and evidencing progress for food loss and food waste reduction is strongly required. For example, edible and inedible parts of food need to be disaggregated to help inform decision making. Furthermore, there is a need for a data repository on food loss and waste measurement as well as greater levels of consumer education e.g. best-before dates. Food and beverage packaging This is high on agendas for retailers, manufactures and brand owners. Connecting startups with industry here is important. There is a significant opportunity and need around developing a gold-standard for eco-labelling as well as a focus on education for consumers in general. Protein diversification There is a critical need to accelerate innovation to market in this field and enable appropriate policy frameworks to incentivise the transition to diversified protein sources. There is also a strong need to increase consumer awareness to facilitate behaviour change. Opportunities Agriculture and primary production Regenerative Agriculture is a significant opportunity yet currently no commonly accepted definition nor impact indicator exists. Incorporating low emission, carbon sequestration and sustainable farming practices to regenerate soils, boost productivity, increase yields, reduce emissions and capture carbon has the potential to reduce carbon by 10.5 Gt CO2 every year. Supporting tech and capabilities Methane capture, feed additives, precision farming, plant and soil microbiome, new breeds, gene editing, animal health and husbandry, solutions to fertilizer and anaerobic digestors. Pricing of carbon will be a key component in supporting farmers to fund the negative emission technology needed to achieve net zero. Food loss and food waste Focussing on primary production and consumers, as well as the valorisation of side streams. Supporting tech and capabilities End-of-use and waste: Recovery, e.g. recycling Landfills e.g. anaerobic digestion of food waste Game based apps Food packaging Transforming the packaging system from a linear model towards a circular system where value can be captured in the system and out of the environment Supporting tech and capabilities Transitioning away from fossil fuel monomers Sustainable packaging by design Substrate additives and materials, active and intelligent packaging, smart labels and edible coatings Protein diversification In production and consumption. As an opportunity to complement and support the agriculture sector and wild fisheries to feed a growing population. Supporting tech and capabilities Plant diversification, aquaculture and algae biotechnology and synthetic biology. Enablers for change Engagement with policymakers Forging collaboration and partnerships between government, academia, NGOS, industry (from big brands down to small farmers) Knowledge and skills development among farming communities and society, particularly young people Development of resources and infrastructure as well as technological innovation to scale up solutions and drive down costs Scouting innovations with underpinning IP, establishing regulatory experts / expertise to support agrifood start-ups and providing access for start-ups to technical experts, IP support and advice, pilot facilities and farms and support them in accelerating from lab to commercial scale Experimentation in new production methods, products, services, and business models, particularly in use of food waste will be important Public Engagement, particularly with young people to inform on net-zero and raise awareness and increase consumer acceptance of innovative new net-zero solutions.

Home News & updates The 2º edition of Bilbao Campus Experience brings agrifood innovation and international talent to Bizkaia The 2º edition of Bilbao Campus Experience brings agrifood innovation and international talent to Bizkaia The second edition of the Bilbao Campus Experience , organised by EIT Food with the support of the Basque Government and the Provincial Council of Bizkaia , once again champions innovation and acts as a gateway to the Basque entrepreneurial ecosystem. 04 Nov 2025 EIT Food South EIT Food has selected 10 startups with already implemented business solutions to take part in the programme at BAT Tower in Bilbao . Their innovations include: Robots that support agriculture; Early detection of vineyard diseases; New ingredients that enhance the quality of plant-based foods; The transformation of fish scales into collagen; Systems that protect bee colonies; Snacks made from marine by-products; And other biotechnology-related solutions. The agrifood sector is undergoing a major technological transformation, often led by emerging startups. Bizkaia is contributing to this momentum by attracting international talent through the Bilbao Campus Experience , organised by EIT Food , with the support of the Basque Government (Department of Food, Rural Development, Agriculture and Fisheries) and the Provincial Council of Bizkaia (Department of Economic Promotion) . Now in its second edition, the programme has selected 10 startups from nine different countries for a month-long immersive business experience this November. The initiative acts as a point of entry into the vibrant Basque entrepreneurial ecosystem. The official launch took place today at B Accelerator Tower (BAT) in Bilbao. “Bilbao Campus Experience is a transformative and personalised journey, focused on the specific needs of each participant and enabling direct interaction with potential suppliers, customers, investors, and industry leaders“ Participants will also benefit from personalised mentoring , expert guidance , and c ommunity-building opportunities to share knowledge and experiences. Iker Iglesias , Director of Food and Industry Policy at the Basque Government, presented the Basque innovation ecosystem during the launch event, highlighting how such initiatives “open the door to new ventures and provide an excellent platform for rapid and sustainable growth. The solutions presented here are directly relevant to societal needs, and this programme sets an excellent benchmark for collaborative innovation.” Meanwhile, Joseba Mariezkurrena , Director of Entrepreneurship, Talent and Business Competitiveness at the Provincial Council of Bizkaia, outlined the opportunities available to startups in the region: “Bizkaia offers entrepreneurs a unique ecosystem and a comprehensive pathway of support and services that accompany them from the early stages to consolidation and growth. Our goal is for startups to find here the right environment, backing, and opportunities to reach their full potential. This is why Bizkaia stands out today as one of the best places in Europe to launch and scale a startup.” The 10 selected startups share a strong technological focus and come from Poland, Serbia, France, Argentina, Sweden, the Netherlands, Cyprus, Turkey, and Bulgaria . Selection criteria included the innovative nature of their solutions , potential impact , maturity stage , and team strength . MiFood (Poland) develops robots that help reduce food waste and crop losses by 30%, offering an alternative to labour shortages while cutting CO₂ emissions. Veles Sense (Serbia) applies artificial intelligence in agriculture to detect early signs of vineyard stress using thermal imaging, drones, and cameras—identifying issues even before symptoms appear. Happeaz (France) produces vegetarian food (burgers, nuggets, etc.) for both retail and catering sectors. Food 4 You (Argentina) is a biotech company developing unique bacterial blends for plant-based fermentation, combining bioinformatics and traditional methods to create dairy alternatives that “outperform traditional products in both flavour and nutrition.” Food Scales (Sweden) transforms discarded fish scales into food-grade ingredients such as collagen, turning marine by-products into sustainable and innovative solutions. BeeSage (Netherlands) provides a modular early-warning system to protect honeybee colonies from pests and diseases, using lightweight smart devices and a real-time data platform. Freyia Labs (Cyprus) offers an intelligent system for producers of non-alcoholic fermented food and beverages, enhancing batch quality, performance, and regulatory compliance. MycoVibes (Poland) , a biotech startup, produces next-generation mycoprotein derived from shiitake mycelium, enabling animal protein replacement “without compromising on nutrition, taste, or cost.” Enthela (Bulgaria) develops microorganism-based products that reduce the need for chemical inputs in grain production, protecting seeds from environmental fluctuations and chemical stress. Tetis Biotech (Turkey) leads Seanacks , a project that recycles marine by-products such as fish skin and bones into collagen-enriched snacks.

Home Blog From Pitch to Plate: How Football Is Addressing Food Waste From Pitch to Plate: How Football Is Addressing Food Waste 05 Nov 2025 EIT Food South 3 min reading time Across soccer stadiums in Europe, tons of perfectly edible food end up in the bin after every match. From unsold sandwiches at kiosks to leftovers from post-match meals, food waste remains one of the biggest sustainability challenges in the world of sport. According to UEFA’s recent guidelines, an average football match in Europe generates about 0.8 kg of waste per spectator , meaning that a 25,000-seat stadium can produce around 20 tonnes of waste in a single match . These numbers show that for football clubs and players food waste is not a marginal issue: it is central. Leading by Example: Clubs That Value Food, Not Waste Top clubs are starting to act. UEFA and FIFA have set clear sustainability targets that include reducing, redistributing, and composting food waste at matches. Clubs such as Tottenham Hotspur , Athletic Club , and the Johan Cruyff Arena are already implementing circular initiatives to ensure that food is valued, not wasted. These efforts reflect a broader movement within the football community, one that connects sport with social and environmental responsibility, and shows how teamwork off the pitch can be just as powerful as what happens on it. Food Waste: A Real Issue in Youth Tournaments Young footballers often have meals prepared for them during training camps or tournaments, much of that food goes uneaten. Over-serving, distraction, or lack of awareness lead to trays full of leftovers. While small in scale compared to a stadium, these everyday habits reflect a much larger problem. Helping young players understand this link is key to shaping a generation of mindful eaters and responsible citizens . By embedding sustainability and nutrition education in sports, young athletes learn that every bite counts, both for their performance and for the planet. Los Salvacomidas and Athletic Club: Playing for a Better Future In Bilbao, Athletic Club and the Athletic Club Foundation are taking sustainability seriously. The Foundation supports educational and social projects that connect football values with social responsibility, that includes food waste. Their collaboration with EIT Food and Los Salvacomidas by FoodEducators showed how sport can inspire young people to build better habits for the future. Young players aged 9 to 18 explored the connection between nutrition, performance, and sustainability . Through playful challenges, they learned how to reduce food waste before, during, and after their matches. The Women’s C team (aged 14–18) swapped football drills for a different kind of training session. They focused on healthy eating and waste prevention. Guided by the Oreka team , led by Denis Ugalde, Patrizia Vitelli, and Víctor Alonso , the players learned how to plan balanced meals, prepare sustainable shopping lists, and make the most of the food they have. Meanwhile, led by EdukaBilbo , Under-11 players from Athletic Club and children from Fundación Fidias designed a collaborative banner promoting food waste reduction and took part in a scavenger hunt testing everything they learned throughout the sessions. Small Actions, Big Impact The collaboration between Los Salvacomidas by FoodEducators, EIT Food, and Athletic Club proves that change starts with awareness. When young athletes understand the value of food, they carry those lessons beyond the field: to their homes, schools, and communities. Football can do more than entertain millions; it can inspire collective action towards a more sustainable food system . Each training session, meal, and match is an opportunity to rethink how we produce, consume, and respect food. And when it comes to protecting our planet, we’re all on the same team . 🌍⚽ More blog posts by EIT Food South Shining a Light on Regenerative Agriculture in Southern Italy October 17, 2025 blog This September, the EIT Food South team set out on a journey across Southern Italy — a land of olive groves, vineyards, and ancient farming traditions — to explore how innovation and regeneration are reshaping its agricultural future.

Home The Food Fight podcast Next Bite 2025: Canada’s Bold Bet on the Future of Food Next Bite 2025: Canada’s Bold Bet on the Future of Food Canada is making big moves in food system transformation and Europe is watching. With major public investment, fast-growing innovation hubs, and a national push toward regenerative agriculture, Canada is moving from strategy to action. In this first episode of the Next Bite 2025 series, we’re joined by Ron Sauvé, Corporate Financing and Senior Accounts Director at Farm Credit Canada; Kyle Hoyda, Business Development Manager at Calgary Economic Development; and Chris Paterson, CEO of Agrisphere. Together, they share what’s driving momentum across Canada, how collaboration with Europe can create real-world impact, and why the most exciting work is only just beginning. 03 Nov 2025 Synopsis Welcome to the the first episode of our Next Bite spotlight series! Recorded live in Brussels at Next Bite 2025, we're joined by experts across the agri-food sector to explore how food system transformation really happens. What does it take to build a food system that is resilient, investable and genuinely ready for change? Our host Matt Eastland sits down with three leaders shaping Canada’s food innovation landscape: Ron Sauvé from Farm Credit Canada , Kyle Hoyda from Calgary Economic Development and Chris Paterson from Agrisphere . Ron explains what it means when a public bank like FCC commits $2 billion to innovation, and how that changes the conversation around risk, scaling and urgency. Kyle shares Calgary’s approach to future-focused growth, with agri-food and blue food playing a central role. Chris takes us inside the thinking behind the new Food Innovation Hub, a space designed to connect infrastructure with systems change and real community needs. Together, we look at why European collaboration matters, what still holds systems back, and why now is the time to push for aligned capital and action. This is the first time Canadian voices have joined the Food Fight podcast, and we're so excited to see what the future will bring for all of us. Key Takeaways 1. Canada is ready to lead. With Farm Credit Canada recently launching a $2 billion investment fund, the country is putting serious capital behind agri-food transformation. This is a strong signal that Canada sees innovation in food and agriculture as central to its economic and environmental future. The appetite for backing early-stage ideas and taking calculated risks could accelerate the rollout of new technologies across the sector. 2. Calgary is building something bold. From innovation to investment in blue food and alternative proteins, Calgary is positioning itself as a key player in the future of food. Organisations like Agrisphere and Calgary Economic Development are building an innovation culture that supports entrepreneurs, draws in global partners, and puts Calgary on the map as a destination for agri-food leadership. 3. Partnerships matter. System change needs collaboration. Whether it’s government, research, or private enterprise, alignment across sectors is essential. Trust and shared priorities underpin the work being done in Calgary. This collaborative approach is proving to be a strength and a model that other regions can learn from. 4. Shared challenges create global opportunities. Canada and Europe may differ in climate, geography, and regulation, but their core food system issues are strikingly similar. From climate resilience to regenerative practices, both regions are tackling the same big questions. That creates real opportunities for transatlantic knowledge exchange, joint innovation, and shared solutions. 5. Infrastructure is essential. Big ideas only go so far without the right support systems. Calgary’s strength lies in its ability to surround innovators with what they need to scale: funding, tailored facilities, expert networks, and market access. Building this kind of infrastructure is critical if regions want to turn prototypes into products and research into real-world results. 6. Leadership should be human. It's essential to remember the importance of listening, adapting, and staying close to community needs. The guests spoke with candour and practicality. They made clear that successful innovation isn’t just about systems or strategies. It’s also about people who are willing to learn, build trust, and lead with humility. 7. This is just the beginning. This was the first time Canadian partners joined the Food Fight Podcast and their first time participating in Next Bite. But it won’t be the last. The energy, ideas, and openness shared in this episode show what’s possible when the right people come together.

Home Blog Building resilient agriculture: why EIT Food’s new think & do tank can drive change Building resilient agriculture: why EIT Food’s new think & do tank can drive change As Europe faces mounting shocks to its food system, resilience has become a necessity, not a choice. This blog unpacks what resilient agriculture really means - from regenerative practices on farms to system-wide collaboration - and introduces EIT Food’s new Resilient Agriculture Think & Do Tank , designed to unite science, policy, and practice for a sustainable food future. 03 Nov 2025 4 min reading time We’re living through a period of overlapping shocks to the European food system. The COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical events, and extreme weather have sent ripples across supply chains. Farmers have faced economic strain, alongside mounting pressures to comply with environmental standards. These shocks have revealed structural vulnerabilities in the way we produce and distribute our food. That’s why resilient agriculture systems are essential. Europe needs new agricultural models that can absorb, adapt to, and transform in response to shocks - while continuing to provide food, livelihoods and protect ecosystem services. This is not a ‘nice to have’: It’s essential for feeding Europe (and the world) in a fair, sustainable way. What is Resilient Agriculture? Resilience matters at two linked levels. First, at farm and landscape scale: practices such as regenerative soil management, diversified rotations, agroforestry and smarter livestock integration build healthier soils, more biodiversity and better water retention that reduce vulnerability to droughts, floods and pest outbreaks. Second, at system scale: stronger supply chains, improved data-sharing, financing instruments that reward stewardship, and governance that supports living labs and farmer-led innovation make the whole food system less brittle. EIT Food’s portfolio of projects and programmes show both sides of this coin in action. We are now launching a Think & Do Tank to bring the pieces together. To join the dots, connect stakeholders, and accelerate the transition to resilient agriculture in Europe.. Why launch a dedicated Resilient Agriculture Think & Do Tank now? 1. Complex problems need convening power and joined-up thinking. Resilience isn’t a single technology or policy, it’s an outcome of many coordinated changes across science and technology, markets, policy and behaviour. A think tank focused on resilient agriculture can bring together researchers, farmers, startups, corporates and policymakers to co-create practical solutions, test them in real-world settings, and translate lessons into scalable policies and investments. Over several years, EIT Food has built bridges between innovation and practice through our projects and programmes. A think tank amplifies that role and creates a space for long-term foresight and policy engagement. 2. Policy windows are opening ... if we act quickly and smartly. The European Commission’s Vision for Agriculture and Food to 2040 emphasises resilience, fairness and sustainability. EIT Food formally welcomed that Vision , noting its alignment with community recommendations and the need for innovation-led pathways to real change. A think tank can operate at the interface between such high-level visions and the messy business of implementation, turning aspirations into funding instruments, living labs and farmer-friendly pathways. 3. W e need rapid evidence synthesis and stress-testing. EIT Food’s Food Alert and stress-testing work demonstrates how scenario -tools and “war games” can surface weak points in supply chains and identify interventions before a crisis hits. A resilient agriculture think tank would institutionalise that foresight capability for agricultural systems by building stress -tests, evaluating policy options, and advising on risk-reducing investments. That kind of anticipatory work saves costs and protects livelihoods. 4. Scaling regenerative and carbon-smart farming requires coordination and finance. Initiatives such as the Regenerative Innovation Portfolio and LILAS4SOILS show two complementary approaches: the Portfolio aims to scale regenerative models across value chains, while LILAS4SOILS uses living labs and carbon-farming trials to restore soil health and create on-the-ground evidence. A think tank can help connect pilots and portfolios to the financial instruments, procurement pathways and regulatory signals farmers need to adopt resilient practices at scale. Diverse challenges require diverse expertise “Resilient agriculture is a very important strategic pillar for EIT Food. It has already been the case and it is now growing more and more for the future we would like to build. The ambition of the group is to really drive transformation, wherever there is a problem at the moment. It really focuses on issues and challenges that we need to solve, to be able to transform agriculture. Let it be technical, let it be regulatory, let it be social, we are looking at all the areas that are unsolved at the moment to really find ways to change them as a group.” Gulsah Uysal, Director or Partnership and Corporate Services, EIT Food. The EIT Food Resilient Agriculture Think & Do Tank brings together diverse expertise, from farmers to scientists, to entrepreneurs and policymakers, who all have an important role within the Think & Do Tank. “The extent of the expertise that we need to bring on the table needs to call for everyone from academia, to the economic system, we need to bring all of these dimensions around the table to think together what is the direction, transformation and reconfiguration of the system and what will make it resilient and fit for this new era that will be anything but stable or predictable.” - Damien Jourdan, Director of Cofinance and Partnerships Agriculture Europe, Danone. Investing in resilient agriculture is not just an environmental or ethical choice, it’s an economic one. Every euro spent on measures that reduce yield volatility, restore soils, and shorten brittle supply chains reduces future disaster costs and preserves livelihoods. Consider becoming an EIT Food partner and connecting with the Think & Do Tank.
