Home | News | Three EIT Health innovators nominated for EIT Awards SHARE fb tw in Three EIT Health innovators nominated for EIT Awards 9th October 2025 We are delighted to announce that three innovators supported by EIT Health have been nominated for this year’s EIT Awards, recognising excellence across innovation, entrepreneurship, and impact. These nominations are a testament to their pioneering work and to EIT Health’s commitment to supporting disruptive solutions in healthcare. Meet our nominees ABLE Human Motion (Spain) Nominated for the EIT Venture Award , ABLE Human Motion develops, manufactures, and commercialises robotic exoskeletons aimed at improving mobility, health and quality of life for people with disabilities. Their mission is to democratise the use of robotics in rehabilitation: by offering advanced technology that is not only highly intuitive but also versatile and more affordable. ABLE’s journey has been supported through both EIT Health innovation projects and programmes providing critical financial, training, and mentorship support to validate the clinical need for their product. Clinical trials in leading neurorehabilitation hospitals in Germany and Spain enhanced their credibility and impact. Their exoskeleton obtained CE marking for clinical use a year ago, thanks in part to the support provided by EIT Health, and since then they have successfully placed 25 devices on the market. Antegenes BRIGHT Project Innovation Team Nominated for the EIT Innovation Team Award, Antegenes’ EIT Health-funded innovation project, BRIGHT, brought together a cross-disciplinary team spanning business, research, and education (including Antegenes, the University of Tartu, North Lisbon University Hospital Centre, Uppsala University, IESE Business School, and Tartu University Hospital) as a successful example of public–private collaboration. The project sought to transform breast cancer prevention and screening by adopting a personalised, risk-based approach: combining Antegenes’ innovative polygenic risk score test, AnteBC , with traditional genetic information to identify women at higher risk, thereby enabling earlier and more targeted interventions. The project created a new service, including an innovative telemedicine solution, for European healthcare – Genetics-Based Personalised Breast Cancer Prevention and Screening . This service has already been implemented in several countries, including the first integration into a public breast cancer screening programme. The goal is to prevent avoidable cancers, reduce late-stage diagnoses, and lower preventable deaths from breast cancer, while optimising the use of healthcare resources. Inès Hamouda (France) Nominated for the EIT Changemaker Award , co-founder of FLOWTION, Inès has created an AI-powered digital twin platform that analyses body movement and offers real-time voice and visual feedback. The platform uses computer vision and machine learning algorithms to recognize postures, detect asymmetries, and provide personalised guidance during training or rehabilitation. Inès is an alumna of EIT Health’s Top Female Founder Summer School , where during an intensive four-week programme she sharpened her entrepreneurial skills, built a go-to-market strategy, and co-developed her startup project in an international team. What this reflects These nominations showcase several key strengths of the EIT Health ecosystem: Impact across domains : from medical devices to AI-powered platforms, and from innovation in disease prevention to rehabilitation technology. Patient-centred innovation : all projects are directly addressing unmet health needs — be it restoring mobility, detecting disease earlier, or improving rehabilitation outcomes. Support for entrepreneurship & scaling : each nominee has benefited either from an EIT Health’s programme and / or has been supported through one of our cross-border consortia innovation projects. Through this support they have increased their scalability and market readiness. Diversity in approach and geography : we see projects from across Europe and across sectors (device makers, digital health, prevention), as well as participation by female founders and cross-country collaboration. Looking ahead We extend our warm congratulations to ABLE Human Motion, the BRIGHT Project Innovation Team, and Inès Hamouda. Their nominations are not just personal achievements — they reflect the success of collective efforts to foster innovation, inclusion, and better healthcare across Europe. Stay tuned as we follow their journeys in the awards process. Whichever way the honours fall, EIT Health is proud to stand behind these innovators pushing boundaries and transforming health outcomes. The EIT Awards ceremony takes place on 25 November in Budapest; the event will also be available to watch online. Learn more about the EIT Awards 2025 here.

We have also helped provide Ukraine with over: 500,000 vital pieces of equipment like breathing apparatus, mobile X-Ray units and volumetric pumps 250,000 dressings 131,000 antiseptic kits 10,000 first aid kits and tourniquets 500 diabetic kits and glucomonitors The 2023 EIT Strategic Regional Innovation (SRI) Cluster, coordinated by EIT Health, has become a leader of the Work Package dedicated to Ukraine. It is a unique collaboration platform between seven EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) in all countries that have status as moderate or modest innovators in Europe. We cover 22 regions in Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe. At EIT Community SRI Cluster, we strongly emphasise our dedication to Ukraine by providing its citizens and organisations with numerous opportunities through our programmes. Operating within the EIT Community, these initiatives actively promote and nurture innovation, entrepreneurship, and sustainability throughout Ukraine. By extending funding, mentorship, and training to Ukrainian entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we strive to establish an environment that fosters economic growth, entrepreneurial spirit, and innovation within the country.

Who We Are Who We Are Watch our story About Us EIT Health was established in 2015, as a ‘knowledge and innovation community’ (KIC) of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). The EIT is made up of various KICs who each focus on a different sector, or area, of innovation – in our case, that is health and aging. The idea behind the EIT KICs is that innovation flourishes best when the right people are brought together to share expertise. The so called ‘knowledge triangle’, is the principle that when experts from business, research and education work together as one, an optimal environment for innovation is created. Find out more: Read about our strategic agenda for the period of 2021-2027 and Business Plan for 2023-2025 . Our Network Putting the theory of the ‘knowledge triangle’ into action requires a collaborative approach. So, we work across borders with over 100 EIT Health member organisations and thousands of start-ups and entrepreneurs, bringing together the brightest minds in healthcare to answer some of the biggest health challenges Europe faces. Through this unique collaborative approach, we are empowering a network of innovators to overcome barriers, challenge convention and take action to put innovative products and services into the hands of those that need them the most.

The healthcare sector offers a meaningful and fulfilling career, paved with competitive remuneration and excellent working conditions. Plus, the chance to be at the forefront of cutting-edge research, technology, and innovation. Yet, data demonstrates that healthcare companies are not visible amongst the most attractive employers in the eyes of talent. [1] The WorkInHealth Foundation will support in addressing this reputational challenge and promote healthcare as a sector in which talent can thrive. “ If Europe is to maintain a vibrant and sustainable healthcare sector that can lead in innovation, we must rise to the challenge of recruiting and educating the best talent. ” – Celine Carrera, Director of Education at EIT Health and WorkInHealth Foundation Chair.
