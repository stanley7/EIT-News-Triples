EIT LOGIC CONSTELLATION ANALYZER - USER GUIDE

SETUP & RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS


Step 1: Start the Backend (Google Colab)
1. Open Google Colab (colab.research.google.com)
2. Upload "eit_triplet_extractor_backend.py" to Colab
3. Run all cells in the notebook
4. Wait for the models to load (takes 2-3 minutes)
5. Look for TWO ngrok URLs in the output:
   Extract: https://xyz.ngrok-free.dev/extract_triplets
   Scrape: https://xyz.ngrok-free.dev/scrape_url
6. COPY BOTH URLs - you'll need them for the frontend


Step 2: Update Frontend with Backend URLs
1. Open "eit_constellation_analyzer.html" in a text editor
2. Find TWO lines (search for "EXTRACT_URL" and "SCRAPE_URL"):
   
   const EXTRACT_URL = "https://your-url.ngrok-free.dev/extract_triplets";

   const SCRAPE_URL = 'https://your-url.ngrok-free.dev/scrape_url';

3. Replace BOTH URLs with your ngrok URLs from Step 1
4. Save the file

Step 3: Run the Frontend
1. Double-click "eit_constellation_analyzer.html" to open it in your browser
2. The analyzer will open in your default web browser
