# About

This repository contains a comparison of human-annotated and GPT-4-generated triples extracted from European innovation news and press releases. Each row represents a triple consisting of:

- Role: The main action or relationship

- Counterrole: The external entity or beneficiary

- Context: The sentence or paragraph from which the triple was extracted

- Confidence: The annotator's confidence (percentage) in the triple

For each context, youâ€™ll find both the human-evaluated triple and a triple generated by GPT allowing for direct comparison.
