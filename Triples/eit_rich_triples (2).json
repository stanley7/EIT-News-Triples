This package aims to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. Apart from emission reduction, the Fit for 55 includes concrete targets for energy storage and conversion, including electric mobility and renewable energy. An overall target of 40% for energy from renewable sources is also set in the package, indicating a significant increase in wind and solar power capacity. This inherently implies a significant increase in the demand for minerals and metals. Hence, a resilient European raw materials sector is the primary enabler of greenhouse gas emissions reduction. A transition away from a fossil fuel-based energy economy will, in the next decade, be based on energy conversion technologies such as solar, wind and fuel cells, as well as energy storage in various forms such as batteries and hydrogen. Sustainable battery value chains Today, the production of batteries and conversion technologies are not sustainable, and this is one of the important topics we need to address when moving forward: How do we ensure that the whole value chain, from the mine to the vehicle or the energy system, is sustainable? This question was highlighted at the EIT RawMaterials Baltic Sea Stakeholder Day in a panel discussion with Ulla Lassi, Professor and Head of the Unit at the University of Oulu, Piritta Salonen, Head of Process Technology at Finnish Minerals Group, and Darren Townsend, Chief Development Officer at NeoMetals.\"",
