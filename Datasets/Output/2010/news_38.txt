On 17 June, the EITâ€™s Call for Proposals for EIT Water officially closed.
Over the past months, the EIT has hosted a series of information sessions, events and a networking platform designed to equip prospective applicants with the information needed for a successful proposal. Consortia consisting of businesses, higher education institutes and research organisations from across Europe were invited to apply with their vision on how EIT Water will deliver innovative solutions to the current challenges that the water, marine and maritime sectors face. We are pleased to announce that five consortia have submitted their proposals.
Next steps in the evaluation process
With the submission window now closed, the evaluation process begins. From June to September 2025, applications will be assessed by a panel of independent external experts. By the end of October 2025, the EIT Governing Board (GB) will confirm evaluation results and invite those applicants to the EIT GB hearings who have reached the threshold of 70/100. The hearings are scheduled to take place in November 2025.

Following the hearings, the EIT Governing Board will designate the winning consortium. All applicants will receive written feedback on their proposals after the evaluation process concludes. The winning consortium will be invited to submit a Startup Plan between late December 2025 and early January 2026. The Startup Grant Agreement is expected to be signed in February 2026. Upon successful completion of the startup phase, the EIT will enter into a 7-year Partnership Agreement with the new Knowledge and Innovation Community (KIC) in late 2026 or early 2027.
