The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) is proud to announce that the EIT Deep Tech Talent Initiative has achieved its goal of training one million people in deep tech fields.
This major milestone strengthens the EU’s competitiveness by equipping its workforce with the advanced skills needed to lead in emerging technologies.
Under the Initiative, the EIT and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), together with partner organisations, are delivering training and skills programmes across Europe. These are open to learners of all ages – from school pupils through higher education students to professionals and entrepreneurs. The
EIT Deep Tech Talent Initiative
provides funding for learning materials, while the EIT leverages its network of partners to build a strong alliance of training providers, companies, universities, public authorities, and financiers.
Training the talents behind tomorrow’s innovations is central to our mission. By connecting people and organisations across Europe, we are building a community that will give us the skills to boost Europe’s competitiveness and tackle major challenges.
Martin Kern, Director of the EIT
To reach the goal of training one million talents, the EIT Deep Tech Talent Initiative worked with over 600 partner organisations who signed the Pledge, alongside the KICs and other EIT Community initiatives offering courses. Among the top contributors in terms of talent trained are Pledgers such as JA Europe, Intel Corporation, Generation Italy, Generation UK, UiPath, Helixconnect Europe, Tampere University of Applied Sciences, MinnaLearn, Kodluyoruz (We Code), and Generation Spain. The countries with the highest number of talents trained include Norway, Austria, Greece, Ukraine, and France.
The Initiative has built a catalogue of over 210 deep tech courses, with 16% focused on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Other popular topics include Advanced Computing and Quantum Computing, Innovation and Entrepreneurship in Deep Tech, Advanced Materials, and Advanced Manufacturing. Most courses are geared towards professional training and academic programmes, with an average duration of 705 hours. Women make up 36% of all trained talents.
