During her recent visit to the Joint Research Centre in Seville, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was introduced to Remonda, a circular economy initiative supported by the EIT Community

The encounter offered an opportunity to showcase how EU-backed innovation can drive local change, empower young talent, and offer tangible solutions to environmental challenges.
From Orange Peels to Bioplastics
Remonda is led by a dynamic team of young female innovators, Monica, Celia and Marina, who are transforming a local challenge into a sustainable opportunity. Inspired by the vast number of orange trees in Seville – which produce nearly six million kilos of oranges each year – the team has developed a process to convert discarded orange peels into biodegradable bioplastics.
A Project Rooted in Community-Led Action
The project emerged from a Climathon in Seville, a local innovation event organised under the umbrella of Climate-KIC. From this initial spark, the team went on to receive recognition through the EIT Community New European Bauhaus Ideation Awards, where Remonda won the Audience Award in 2022. Supported by the EIT Community, Remonda is now developing a minimum viable product and conducting further research to scale up its impact.
Connecting Local Talent to a Continental Network
As part of Europe’s largest innovation ecosystem, the EIT Community brings together more than 2 400 partners across 70+ hubs, enabling ventures like Remonda to grow from grassroots ideas into real-world solutions. The visit from President von der Leyen highlights how EIT-supported initiatives are contributing to a greener, more resilient Europe – one peel at a time.
