EIT Digital and the
Hellenic Centre for Defence Innovation
(HCDI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding in Thessaloniki, marking a significant step toward further developing, internationalizing, and empowering Greek startups in the dual-use technology sector.
The agreement establishes a broad framework for collaboration focused on accelerating the growth of Greece's innovation ecosystem and integrating it into European and global markets.
We are proud to announce our collaboration with HCDI and are confident that the jointly launched National Dual-Use Technology Accelerator will be a cornerstone in securing Europe's future. By fostering collaboration between industries, academia, and startups, Europe is well-positioned to become a global leader in secure, ethical, and innovative dual-use solutions
Federico Menna, CEO of EIT Digital
A central element of this partnership is the launch of the National Dual-Use Technology Accelerator, an initiative designed to bolster Europe’s capabilities in technologies that serve both civilian and defence applications.
The programme will foster cross-sector collaboration by bringing together industry, academia, and startups to develop innovative solutions for complex technological challenges.
The partnership also includes concerted efforts to raise awareness and outreach through co-hosted information days, webinars, and joint participation in events aimed at promoting opportunities for Greek companies. To support startup and SME growth, the organisations will provide access to HCDI innovation processes and EIT Digital’s Growth Services, facilitating funding, commercial partnerships, and market entry.
Strategic outreach initiatives will involve co-hosting high-impact events and facilitating delegations to key allied markets such as the U.S., UK, Nordics, and Indo-Pacific, helping Greek companies expand their international presence. Additionally, the collaboration will focus on technology transfer, strengthening ties between R&D centres, universities, and industry to support spinouts and intellectual property commercialization.
EIT Digital operates Europe's largest deep tech innovation ecosystem and plays a vital role in connecting local and regional excellence with the broader European technology and innovation landscape. By linking Greece's entrepreneurial talent to EIT Digital's EU-wide network, we can accelerate growth, attract international investment, and ensure that local breakthroughs contribute to Europe's digital leadership and technological sovereignty
Federico Menna, CEO of EIT Digital
The initiative aligns with broader European goals of achieving greater technological independence and strategic autonomy. By developing dual-use technologies within a framework that emphasizes security and ethics, the partnership seeks to reduce external dependencies while promoting values-based innovation. The success of this collaboration may serve as a model for future cross-sector partnerships in other strategic technology areas across Europe.
