Climate KIC
, a member of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), has emerged as the top beneficiary of Horizon Europe Missions funding, securing nearly €100 million to advance its climate innovation agenda.
Rapid Response to a New Funding Model
When Horizon Europe Missions launched in 2021, Climate KIC, formerly EIT Climate-KIC, quickly positioned itself as a key vehicle for delivering this new type of research programme. Climate KIC has secured €99 million across 19 Mission projects – far more than any other grantee of the scheme’s €2.24 billion grant portfolio, which spans 295 projects.
About the Missions: Focused, Challenge-led Funding
The Missions are the EU’s latest research funding experiment. Rather than focusing solely on traditional cross-border research, they aim to fund demonstrators and capacity-building projects that drive innovation and attract external investment in five focus areas: cancer; climate adaptation; oceans and rivers; soil; and climate-neutral cities.
Strengthening Financial Independence
The new policy was introduced just as Climate KIC was moving towards independence from the EIT. According to the EIT model, EIT KICs are expected to generate their own revenue and become financially sustainable in 15 years. In 2024, following the
signing of a Memorandum of Cooperation with the EIT
, Climate KIC entered a new phase as a financially sustainable member of the EIT Community, continuing to align with the EIT model while operating with greater autonomy. In 2021, Climate KIC’s budget stood at €39.1 million – including €1.8 million from membership fees and €6.7 million from external funders.
The €99 million from Horizon Missions represents a significant amount for the network, which received €720 million in EIT funding between 2010 and 2024.
Mega-projects Driving Impact Across Europe
Much of this funding comes from large-scale projects designed to build critical mass around the Missions. One flagship example is the €53 million
NetZeroCities project
, which is developing a support platform for the Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission. As coordinator, EIT Climate receives €36 million from the project.
Another major initiative is
Pathways2Resilience
, which aims to empower 100 regions and communities to improve their climate resilience. The €29 million project includes €21 million in funding for local adaptation actions, with EIT Climate managing €23 million of the total.
Climate KIC: A Flagship of the EIT Model
Climate KIC’s Horizon Missions success highlights the strength of the EIT model – driving systemic innovation through a uniquely integrated approach. As part of Europe’s largest innovation ecosystem, Climate KIC continues to deliver climate impact at scale while advancing the EIT’s mission to build a greener, more sustainable future.
