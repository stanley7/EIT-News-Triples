Climate KIC
has launched ‘Inclusive Design for Climate Innovation: A Practitioner’s Guide’, a practical resource designed to transform how climate innovation programming approaches inclusivity from the ground up.
In today’s climate innovation landscape, the most effective solutions emerge when diverse voices are not just invited to participate but are empowered to lead. This guidebook, developed by Climate KIC in collaboration with
BopInc
, offers a structured framework to embed inclusivity at every stage of programme development.
Why Does Inclusivity Matter in Climate Innovation?
True inclusivity extends beyond gender equality to embrace diversity across underrepresented groups. As thought leader Verna Myers notes: diversity is ‘being invited to the dance’, while inclusion is ‘being asked and able to dance’. Designing climate initiatives with inclusivity as a foundation – rather than an afterthought – helps unlock more innovative, sustainable and equitable outcomes.
Who is This Guidebook For?
This resource is especially valuable for:
organisations supporting climate entrepreneurs and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs);
programme designers seeking step-by-step guidance on inclusive practices;
project managers who value inclusivity but lack practical tools and methods;
teams aiming to move beyond surface-level diversity metrics towards meaningful inclusion.
What Does the Guidebook Offer?
The guidebook introduces a comprehensive five-step project lifecycle framework – from initiation and planning to execution, monitoring, evaluation and closure. It includes practical exercises to help teams:
understand what inclusivity truly means beyond tracking numbers;
involve target groups meaningfully throughout the process;
measure impact using inclusive metrics;
examine power dynamics within organisations and value chains;
design programmes and climate initiatives with inclusivity in mind from day one.
While no programme or project can be fully inclusive from the start, this guidebook supports the iterative process needed to develop truly equitable climate solutions.
Supporting Inclusive Climate Innovation Across Europe
As part of the EIT Community’s ongoing commitment to inclusive climate action, this work builds on efforts by Climate KIC and partners including
CATAL1.5°T
,
Irish Aid
, Green Hub and the
Salesforce Foundation
. These partners help identify inclusion gaps and implement concrete actions to embed inclusive practices into day-to-day work across the climate innovation sector.
