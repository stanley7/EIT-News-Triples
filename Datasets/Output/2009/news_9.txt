The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) has opened a new Community Hub in Slovakia, connecting local innovators, entrepreneurs and partners to Europe’s largest innovation network. The hub will act as a one-stop shop for local talent to access EIT opportunities, strengthening links between business, education and research.
The launch took place at Kulturpark in Košice, bringing together public officials, business leaders, startups and innovators. The programme featured keynote speeches, panel discussions and networking with EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs).
For me, this hub is first and foremost about people. It means that a young founder in Košice, a researcher in Bratislava, or a student with a bold idea can now more easily find support and partners across Europe. I believe this is how Slovakia can make its mark – by opening doors for our talent and letting their work speak for itself
Ján Oravec, member of the EIT’s Governing Board
The new hub will serve as a central platform for entrepreneurs, researchers, students and businesses to connect with the EIT’s wide range of programmes – from education and skills development to business creation and innovation support.
Supporting Slovakia’s Innovation Potential
The hub is part of the EIT
Regional Innovation Scheme
, which aims to bridge Europe’s innovation divide by boosting competitiveness and supporting sustainable economic growth in regions with high innovation potential. Through this new presence, the EIT Community will increase its collaboration with Slovak partners, provide innovators with access to EU-wide opportunities, and strengthen policy engagement at the local level.
Results 2021–2024
Between 2021 and 2024, Slovakia secured €8.7 million in EIT funding. With this support, the EIT  backed 78 ventures, involved 7 675 participants in training, and helped to launch 11 innovations. Looking ahead, Slovakia has the chance to expand its role by deepening ties with KICs and mobilising national stakeholders, strengthening its place in Europe’s innovation landscape.
Expanding the EIT Community Across Europe
With the launch of today’s hub in Slovakia, the EIT strengthens its on-the-ground presence in Central, Eastern and Southern Europe. Similar hubs are being established in more than 20 countries, each designed to bring the benefits of Europe’s largest innovation ecosystem closer to local innovators.
As part of Europe’s largest innovation ecosystem, the EIT brings together over 2 400 partners across 70+ hubs, has supported more than 9 900 ventures and has helped launch over 2 450 new products and services to market.
