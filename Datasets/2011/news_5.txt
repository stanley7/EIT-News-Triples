To underline the EIT’s mission and intention to closely collaborate with its three Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), the EIT Headquarters based in Budapest has decided to host offices for the KICs.
Yesterday the first KIC Office was inaugurated for Climate-KIC. As outlined in the EIT Regulation, the EIT comprises of three elements: the EIT Governing Board, the EIT Director's team and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities and it is thus important for the EIT and the KICs to have the option to closely work together.
The office was inaugurated by John Schellnhuber (Chairman of the Climate KIC’s General Assembly) and Alexander von Gabain (Chairman of the EIT Governing Board) in the presence of Mary Ritter (Climate-KIC CEO) and José Manuel Leceta (EIT Director). Representatives from their community were also present to celebrate the piloting style of close collaboration the EIT has with private companies, higher education institutes and research centres from across Europe as members of its KICs. Now the EIT and its KIC partners can really work together under “the same roof” both literally and figuratively.
The inauguration of the Climate-KIC office took place during a busy week for Climate-KIC here in Budapest.
The inauguration followed Climate-KIC’s General Assembly and preceded its
Innovation Festival
