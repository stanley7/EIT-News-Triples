On Saturday 25 June, Dr. Martin Schuurmans (Chairman of the EIT Governing Board) presented the EIT, its vision and achievements at the China – Eastern and Central European Countries Economic and Trade Forum, which took place in Budapest.
In front of Prime Minister Viktor Orban (Hungary), Prime Minister Wen JiaBao (People’s Republic of China) and high level representatives from both Eastern and Central European countries and the People’s Republic of China, Dr Schuurmans stressed that whilst the EIT’s main goal is to create a new European way of delivering essential economic growth and societal benefits through innovation, the institute is an EU body with an international vision. To truly drive world-class innovation, the EIT and its KICs (Knowledge and Innovation Communities) must forge close relationships with leading innovative organizations across the globe.
Setting up the EIT and its KICs has been the top priority since 2008. However, in the years to come international collaborations will have to be fully explored and implemented. Indeed, developing the EIT’s international dimension is a crucial component of the EIT’s vision for the future as outlined in its
Strategic Innovation Agenda (SIA)
