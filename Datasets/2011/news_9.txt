2010 was the KICs' kick-off year: the EIT's three Knowledge and Innovation Communities (Climate-KIC, EIT ICT Labs and KIC InnoEnergy) took shape as organisations led by an independent management team and each defined their legal structure.
In parallel, the EIT Headquarters were set up and developed in Budapest, the location chosen as the seat of the EIT by the European Council.
The first activities of the EIT and its KICs, notably in the fields of higher education and entrepreneurship development were also started in 2010.
