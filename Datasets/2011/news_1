In the fall of 2012 EIT ICT Labs Master School will be able to welcome its first students (approximately 200).
The KIC launched the
Master School's website
where you can find all information about the various choices of our Master's programmes in ICT Innovation that are offered in different combinations at almost 20 universities in Europe.
Visit the website to also find out more about how it combines a technical major and a minor in Innovation and Entrepreneurship, providing graduates with double degrees and a special EIT and EIT ICT Labs certificate.
Students who will take the chance and fullfill the programme will gain a fantastic network of exclusive contacts with leading research and business organisations and fellow students all over Europe.
The application period opens on January 1 and closes on February 15.
