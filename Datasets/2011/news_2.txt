A Startup weekend is an intense 54 hour event that focuses on transforming high tech, design, web or mobile business idea into a prototype, market strategy or business case. The weekend brings together  people with different skills – primarily developers, creatives and entrepreneurs – to create prototypes  and develop commercial cases.
The Eindhoven Startup weekend gathered 60 partipants that formed 10 teams and pitched 32 ideas. At the end of the weekend five of the teams had working prototypes.
The jury, including EIT ICT Labs Eindhoven Node Director Patrick Strating, selected team Fairy Tale as the winner. Their application uses augmented reality to encourage children to play outdoors.
