On 18th June, EU Member States decided unanimously that the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) will have its headquarters in Budapest.
The Hungarian capital had been one of five candidates that expressed an interest in hosting the EIT headquarters : Jena (Germany), Sant Cugat (Spain), Wroc≈Çaw (Poland) and the "Twin City" of Vienna / Bratislava (Austria / Slovakia).
The discussions on the location of the EIT headquarters clearly reflected the genuine interest and strong mobilisation of national, regional and local authorities across the Union in support of the EIT.
