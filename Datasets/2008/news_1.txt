Dr Martin Schuurmans, Chairman of the EIT's Governing Board, was invited to Brussels on 2 December 2008 in order to present latest developments of the EIT to the Council of Ministers and at the European Parliament. As co-legislators, the two institutions had adopted the EIT's legal base earlier in the year.
Dr Schuurmans had been invited to meet Ministers at the Competitiveness Council, where he presented the vision and strategy of the EIT Governing Board, as well as an overview of latest developments. He was equally invited for an exchange of views at the European Parliament's Industry, Research and Energy Committee (ITRE), where he updated Members of the Committee on the progress in implementing the EIT (see presentation). The EIT Chairman assured both his audiences that the EIT's Governing Board is very committed to bringing this initiative forward and making it a true success for Europe.
