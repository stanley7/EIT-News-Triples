Each year, the EIT recognises the outstanding achievements of members of its
Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs)
through the EIT Awards that are presented in three categories:
The
EIT CHANGE Award
celebrates
graduates
from EIT labelled education programs who spur innovation and entrepreneurship and bring about a change in the thematic areas addressed by the EIT and its KICs.
The
EIT Innovators Award
recognises KIC
innovation teams
composed of individuals from across the knowledge triangle that have developed a product, service or process with a high potential for societal and economic impact.
The
EIT Venture Award
puts successful entrepreneurial
start-ups
that have been supported by the KICs through a dedicated business creation or business development process in the spotlight
Do you want to compete for one of the Awards or do you want to put a graduate, team or venture, forward?  The competition is now open!
