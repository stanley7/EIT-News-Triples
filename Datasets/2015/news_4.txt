Today, the EIT has published the
Framework of Guidance for the EIT’s 2016 Call for KIC proposals
.
To further enhance its impact and to incentivise the innovations needed to meet societal challenges, we’re continuing to expand our activities in 2016 by launching a call for two new Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs):
EIT Food: ensuring a climate-resilient and sustainable global food value chain
EIT Manufacturing: strengthening and increasing the competitiveness of Europe’s manufacturing industry.
Following the publication of the
Evaluation Criteria
in October 2015, the Framework of Guidance for the EIT’s 2016 Call for KIC proposals is intended to help those interested in forming a KIC.

This document presents what the EIT is and how it works, what the KICs are and how they work and what makes a KIC successful. Based on the lessons learnt since the establishment of the EIT and its first three KICs as well as the 2014 Call for KIC proposals, it also contains tips on starting a KIC and key information on what happens after the designation of new KICs including EIT and KIC contractual relations, the EIT funding model and the EIT monitoring system.
