On 28 November, Budapest, Hungary, hosted the EIT Jumpstarter Grand Final, the culmination of this year's edition of the pre-acceleration programme EIT Jumpstarter – an initiative of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), a body of the European Union, which aims to train and convert innovative ideas into budding businesses.
The event showcased 49 teams from 21 countries, competing across nine categories for prizes worth a total of EUR 150 000. The competition highlighted science-based innovations designed to address urgent societal challenges across sectors such as food, energy, and health.
