In anticipation of the upcoming Call for Proposals for EIT Water, the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) has published the Innovation Model Paper, a comprehensive guide for organisations eager to collaborate with the EIT on tackling societal challenges through innovation.
The
new EIT Knowledge and Innovation Community
(KIC) on water, marine, and maritime sectors will address critical water-related challenges by uniting stakeholders from academia, business, and research to tackle key issues in these sectors while nurturing innovation. The Call, set to launch in January 2025, will invite consortia to propose comprehensive strategies for fostering innovation, business creation, and entrepreneurial education within the water, marine and maritime sectors and ecosystems.
The EIT Innovation Model Paper serves as a key resource for applicants of the Call, offering a detailed explanation of the EIT model and its application to addressing societal challenges. By exploring the paper, readers can gain a clear understanding of how the EIT integrates the Knowledge Triangle of business, research, and education to foster innovation ecosystems. This framework is essential for structuring successful proposals that align with the EIT’s approach.
The paper also provides insights into the EIT’s governance model and financial sustainability strategies. For organisations interested in working with the EIT Community, these sections demonstrate how to design initiatives that are not only innovative but also scalable, sustainable, and impactful. Additionally, the paper highlights best practices from existing KICs, offering real-world examples of successful innovation, business creation and entrepreneurial education programmes.
