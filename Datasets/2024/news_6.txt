The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) has published the mid-term evaluation of the EIT Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS) for the 2021–2027 programming period. Launched in 2014, the EIT RIS aims to address regional disparities in innovation across Europe by extending support to less innovative regions.
The evaluation reviews the scheme’s progress, achievements, and the effectiveness of key documents, including the EIT RIS Implementation Framework (2022–2027). It highlights the significant advancements made, particularly in strengthening the capacity of innovation enablers such as start-ups, incubators, SMEs, and educational institutions.
The evaluation identified notable successes between 2021 and 2023, including the support of 3,361 start-ups and scale-ups, the development and testing of 719 innovations, and the graduation of over 1,000 students from EIT educational programmes. RIS Hubs have been instrumental in expanding geographical outreach, providing crucial support to local stakeholders and fostering collaboration across EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs). Results achieved by KICs related to RIS often exceed expectations outlined in Business Plans and Strategic Agendas. The evaluation also highlighted areas of improvement and challenges including inconsistent regional monitoring, contract durations that may hinder stability, and concerns over financial sustainability. The report emphasises that the interconnected approach of the EIT is key to its continued effectiveness and impact. Looking ahead, the EIT plans to address these challenges and strengthen the role of the EIT Regional Innovation Scheme and especially its EIT Community Hubs being established in all eligible countries.
The evaluation’s recommendations include strengthening communication and dissemination, increasing collaboration with EU decision-makers, and ensuring long-term financial sustainability. It also calls for greater focus on youth entrepreneurship and closer integration of EIT RIS activities into national and regional planning. These findings provide a solid foundation for the continued expansion and refinement of the EIT RIS, aiming to further enhance innovation across Europe.
