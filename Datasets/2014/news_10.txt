The EIT is overcoming fragmentation, promoting cooperation among innovation players and developing new approaches to manage and deliver innovative ideas to instil new vigour in our economy and society with the aim of increasing competitiveness, employment and growth.
As part of its important mission of fostering the advancement of learning in fields which are of particular interest for the development of Europe, the European University Institute (EUI) is continuously looking for talent and new ideas to tackle the major issues on the European integration process.

The exchange of knowledge and dialogue are the basis of an innovative society therefore establishing a connection between the EIT and the EUI is a natural step in developing the EU and in promoting mutual learning.
To maximise the opportunities for co-operation, the EIT Director, José Manuel Leceta, will be personally and directly collaborating with the EUI in Florence to establish close links between the two institutions. During his stay in Florence for the next academic year, the EIT’s Chief Operating Officer, Martin Kern, will act as interim Director to manage the operations of the Institute.
