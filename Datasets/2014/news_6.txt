One of the EIT’s main aims is to create an environment that allows entrepreneurship and innovation to flourish - both as a mind-set and activity. In order to support this aim, the EIT organises annual awards to recognise and reward the successful start-ups, innovative projects and young entrepreneurial talent that Europe has to offer.
The 2015 EIT Awards will be an integral part of the EIT Innovation and Entrepreneurship event that will be held in Budapest on 05 to 07 May 2015. The event will combine four different EIT initiatives in one three day event: the EIT Awards, the EIT Alumni Connect event, the EIT Stakeholder Forum and the EIT Roundtable. More information about the event will be made available soon.
The EIT CHANGE Award
The EIT CHANGE Award celebrates graduates from EIT labelled education programmes that spur innovation and entrepreneurship and bring about change in the thematic areas addressed by the EIT and its KICs. The competition is currently open and the deadline for submission of applications is

.
Launched in 2012, the EIT Awards highlight successful entrepreneurial start-ups that come out of the EIT’s
Knowledge and Innovation Communities
(KICs), and showcase the talent that emerges from the
EIT labelled and KIC educational programmes
. For both the nominees and the winners, the awards are a great opportunity to share their ideas with the world and connect to the innovation community.
