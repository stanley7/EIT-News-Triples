As foreseen in the European Institute of Innovation and Technology’s
2014 Call for KIC proposals
, the submission of proposals has now closed.
The EIT evaluation of the proposals will now begin and two new KICs will be designated in December 2014:
one KIC addressing the theme of innovation for healthy living and active ageing; and
one KIC addressing the theme of raw materials - sustainable exploration, extraction, processing, recycling and substitution.
