EIT Entrepreneurship Seminar confirms key role of entrepreneurship in KICs
The EIT Entrepreneurship Seminar, held on 6-7 May in Wroclaw, Poland, focused on the central role entrepreneurship is going to play within the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs). Speakers highlighted the need for a new entrepreneurial culture in Europe, saying the KICs had the potential to bring about a new generation of entrepreneurs and thus inject a boost into European innovation.
Daria Golebiowska-Tataj, member of the EIT Governing Board's Executive Committee and organiser of the seminar, stressed the importance of entrepreneurship for the success of the EIT: "innovative European entrepreneurs are a major output of every KIC". This view was very much shared by panellists and speakers, who insisted that heterogeneity and co-location were crucial if the KICs were to create a fertile breeding ground for entrepreneurship.

Members of the EIT Governing Board held a high-level lunch meeting with the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso
Members of the EIT Governing Board held a high-level lunch meeting with the President of the European Commission, José Manuel Barroso, Vice-President Günter Verheugen (Enterprise and Industry) and Commissioners Ján Figel' (Education, Training, Culture and Youth) and Janez Potočnik (Science and Research) to discuss the EIT's progress made to date.
Speaking to the press after the meeting, President Barroso highlighted the milestones the EIT Governing Board has achieved since its inauguration on 15th September 2008. He said that in spite of pessimistic voices when the initiative was first proposed, "the EIT is today a promising reality". He was very encouraged by the EIT Governing Board's commitment and congratulated them for having acted swiftly to set up the selection process for the Knowledge and Innovation Communities.
President Barroso also emphasised the role of the EIT in the EU's road to recovery from the current economic crisis, saying the EIT had the potential to be a powerful new driver of sustainable growth and competitiveness in Europe: "Its Knowledge and Innovation Communities are a concrete example of the type of action we need." He confirmed his commitment to ensuring the EIT's success in the future, in particular through further encouraging active business participation in the EIT and efforts to allocate additional budgetary resources to the EIT.
Martin Schuurmans, Chairman of the EIT Governing Board, underlined that the EIT was a new concept – even an experiment – that should help Europe "to move away from being perceived as low in innovation and instead embrace its innovation potential".

YEAR: 2009
The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) launched the call for proposals for its first Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) on Thursday 2 April 2009.
KICs are highly integrated public-private partnerships between higher education, research, business and entrepreneurial actors and will be the operational engine of the EIT. They will be innovative webs of excellence, responding to key societal challenges such as sustainable energy, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and the future information and communication society.
KICs will drive effective new interactions between partners in terms of ideas, technology, culture, business and design models. They will create new business for existing industry, including SMEs, and for new endeavours alike. A strong component of KICs' innovation strategies will be to educate and develop entrepreneurial people working across traditional borders, sectors and disciplines.
Launching the call for proposals for the KICs consists of a major step forward for the EIT. The call will be open until 27 August and the first two or three KICs selected by the end of 2009.

2009 has been very busy for the EIT in the run-up to the call for proposals for the first Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs). The Board notably organized three thematic seminars in order to discuss with potential KIC proposers the focus of the three themes for the first KICs and their synergies with each other.
The first two to three KICs will be selected from 3 themes: future information and communication society, sustainable energy and climate change mitigation and adaptation (Note: although avenues for cross-fertilisation exist between the different themes, each KIC must principally address one of these three themes). The three seminars, hosted in Budapest, Vienna and Madrid respectively, gave interested parties from each priority area the opportunity to engage in an open dialogue with members of the EIT Governing Board.
Each seminar generated much interest from across Europe and beyond, with representatives from business, entrepreneurship, government, higher education, research and technology transfer – reflecting the EIT's objective of bringing together all parts of the innovation web.
The seminars not only generated fruitful discussions, but also provided interested parties with an opportunity for networking and partnering activities in view of the formation of future KICs.

'Excellence for innovation' was the motto of a special day at the EU's pavilion at the Shanghai World EXPO (China) today, dedicated to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). As one of the European Union's flagship initiatives the EIT attracted representatives from Chinese universities, businesses and public authorities to discuss the importance of innovation in a knowledge economy.
Under the theme 'intelligent Europe' the European Union showcases some of its most important activities at the Shanghai EXPO. Anders Flodström, Vice Chairman of the EIT, explains why the EIT is one of them: "The EIT is a European initiative with a clear international vocation. We want to be world-class in innovation - and you cannot be world class by just looking inward".
Jan Truszczyński, Director General for Education and Culture at the European Commission, stressed the novelty of the EIT as the first European initiative to fully integrate actors from innovation, research and education: "With the EIT's Knowledge and Innovation Communities we want to be pioneers for changing the innovation landscape in Europe. They will be hubs of innovation with attractive conditions for working, studying and doing business".
Organised at the EU-Belgian pavilion, the EIT thematic day gathered participants from Chinese higher education institutions, research centres, businesses and associations in the field of science and technology as well as public authorities. Discussions focused on the role of innovation in a knowledge society and on how innovation can be better promoted, and on the exchange of best practice examples from Europe and China in the areas where the EIT currently operates: climate change, sustainable energy and future information and communication society.

The EIT celebrated the official launch of the ‘Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs)' at the 'Launching the KICs - Delivering new solutions to the European innovation landscape' conference in Barcelona on 2-3 June 2010.
The event did not only present EIT stakeholders with their first opportunity to meet the three designated KICs but also allowed them to engage in an open dialogue with them. Four breakout sessions dealt with the key fields addressed by the KICs:
Addressing societal and economic challenges through the KICs
Co-location centres as test beds of world-class innovation
Fostering entrepreneurship and new business creation
Shaping educational programmes through new partnerships
The KICs used this opportunity to further strengthen links between key higher education, research, business and innovation actors.
Dr. Martin Schuurmans, chairman of the EIT Governing Board, hopes the KICs will also encourage entrepreneurial skills and sensible risk-taking.

On Saturday 25 June, Dr. Martin Schuurmans (Chairman of the EIT Governing Board) presented the EIT, its vision and achievements at the China – Eastern and Central European Countries Economic and Trade Forum, which took place in Budapest.
In front of Prime Minister Viktor Orban (Hungary), Prime Minister Wen JiaBao (People’s Republic of China) and high level representatives from both Eastern and Central European countries and the People’s Republic of China, Dr Schuurmans stressed that whilst the EIT’s main goal is to create a new European way of delivering essential economic growth and societal benefits through innovation, the institute is an EU body with an international vision. To truly drive world-class innovation, the EIT and its KICs (Knowledge and Innovation Communities) must forge close relationships with leading innovative organizations across the globe.
Setting up the EIT and its KICs has been the top priority since 2008. However, in the years to come international collaborations will have to be fully explored and implemented. Indeed, developing the EIT’s international dimension is a crucial component of the EIT’s vision for the future as outlined in its
Strategic Innovation Agenda (SIA)

As a driver and key element in combining the different areas of the knowledge triangle and in developing new innovation models, entrepreneurship is at the very heart of the EIT vision and activities. Boosting and encouraging individuals and companies to embrace innovation and take it to the market is among the EIT’s top priorities. As such, the EIT is pleased to announce its first EIT Entrepreneurship Award competition which it is organising in close collaboration with its three Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs): Climate-KIC, EIT ICT Labs and KIC InnoEnergy.
The
2012 Entrepreneurship Awards
will put the spotlight on and encourage entrepreneurial ventures within the
Knowledge and Innovation Communities
thematic areas (climate change adaptation and mitigation, the future of information and communication society and sustainable energy) and help them develop in a successful and sustainable way.
“Mentoring is key for emerging companies. The connection to powerful executives in European industry will give credibility to entrepreneurs. It will hopefully help them get access to new clients, markets and to think big! This is how the EIT wants to leverage its network and help expand companies, which were born in KICs: born-to-be-global” says Daria Tataj, Member of the EIT’s Governing Board’s Executive Committee.
The selection of the nominated ventures is driven by the three KICs and each KIC will put forward three ventures that will be invited to do a business pitch
at a high-level conference, where the three EIT Entrepreneurship Award winners will be selected. The finalists will be given the opportunity to attend a training course on how to successfully present their businesses and will also be given the opportunity to meet with leading entrepreneurs who will provide them with guidance on how to prepare for the scaling up of their businesses.
The high-level conference where the three winners of the EIT Entrepreneurship awards will be selected, is the
EIT Entrepreneurship Awards 2012 / ACES Academic Enterprise Awards and Conference organised in cooperation with

Martin Schuurmans, the first Chairman of the EIT Governing Board, passed on the strategic leadership of the institute to Alexander von Gabain on the occasion of today’s Board meeting.
''It is a great pleasure for me that Alexander is taking on the leadership of the Board. With his distinguished background and career as an entrepreneur, he will lead the EIT into a new era in which, as we have concluded at the EIT, entrepreneurship is so essential for innovation success", says Martin Schuurmans.
The Governing Board took this opportunity to thank Martin Schuurmans for his strong leadership and dedication to setting up the institute and getting its first KICs (Knowledge and Innovation Communities) up and running. “Martin has impressively led the EIT as Chairman of the Governing Board for the past three years, driving the EIT towards becoming a high impact investment institute seeding innovation in Europe” adds Alexander von Gabain.
One of Alexander von Gabain’s immediate priorities will be to focus the EIT’s efforts on becoming a true innovation impact investor; a vision that is outlined in the EIT’s Strategic Innovation Agenda (SIA).  It was thus decided during this meeting to focus the next few years on preparing the EIT for its future growth via the implementation of further KICs as this will lead to a critical impact on Europe’s innovation landscape. To this end, the Governing Board welcomed the proposals put forward by the new EIT Director José Manuel Leceta including a service oriented  EIT offices in Budapest and the setting up of a Corporate Forum, both of which will increase accountability and ultimately add value to the current KIC operations.
The European Commission’s consultation on the future of the EIT found that the EIT stakeholder community has broadly supported the notion that the EIT’s distinctive strength is its entrepreneurial approach to innovation is. In this light, the EIT Governing Board supported the establishment of an EIT Roundtable of Top Entrepreneurs, as a pilot for the setting up of an EIT Academy of Entrepreneurs. This Roundtable will bring together 15 to 20 outstanding individuals with a record of excellence in entrepreneurial and innovative enterprises on an annual basis, to exchange views and experiences. This is intended to serve as a platform for mutual inspiration and dialogue in the field of entrepreneurship and innovation between the EIT, its KICs, top level entrepreneurs and its stakeholder community.
This meeting also saw the adoption of further refined quality criteria for EIT labelled degrees and diplomas and EIT overarching learning outcomes that will be applied to Master and PhD programmes developed by and implemented within the three KICs. EIT labelled degrees form a major element of the EIT‟s intent to deliver a unique brand of excellent and relevant education, responsive to both business and societal demands based on entrepreneurship, creativity and innovation.

The EIT greatly appreciates the constructive input it has received from various sources and European stakeholders on its mission and accomplishments. In particular, the EIT welcomes the external perspective offered and is extremely pleased with the overwhelmingly positive feedback received on its overall mission, concept and first achievements.
The level of positive interest surrounding the EIT in its early stages is powerful evidence of the fact that the EIT and its activities are not only noteworthy but worth pursuing. The results of the Open Consultation show, in the words of the European Commission, “a high level of support to the EIT mission, objectives, and added value”, and the External Evaluation states that “There is a consensus amongst those interviewed for this study that the stated objectives of the EIT are all relevant. Overall, support for the EIT is strong.”
The EIT does not, however, see this as endorsement to rest on its laurels – quite the opposite. It is also very receptive to the constructive criticism mentioned in particular in the External Evaluation. The EIT is very proud, not only to share its accomplishments, but equally importantly, to announce speedy developments since then in setting up the foundations for further progress. In this connection, on 18 May 2011, the EIT Governing Board appointed
José Manuel Leceta
as Director of the EIT. He took up his duties on 01 July 2011 and has already introduced a series of measures to streamline key business processes, to help implement the Board’s future strategies and, most importantly, to add value to KICs including service offerings beyond grant giving.
The Evaluation recommends that the EIT’s focus up to 2014 should be on consolidation and delivery. This is very much being embraced by the EIT Governing Board as it is building upon the lessons learned to date, is focusing on consolidating the efforts undertaken so far to translate these into concrete outcomes, and on further delivering the results and messages needed to turn the EIT into a globally recognised Institute for innovation excellence, both for its operations and intelligence. Beyond this the EIT will be focussing its efforts on becoming a true innovation impact investor under its new Chairman of the Governing Board
Alexander von Gabain
, who took up his role on 15 September 2011.

YEAR: 2011
On 14 April the European Commission launched an open public consultation on the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT).
The consultation was undertaken in order to provide the Commission with stakeholders' views on EIT's future priority areas and on its role in the European innovation landscape.
The outcome of the public consultation serves as input to the preparatory process of the Strategic Innovation Agenda (SIA) and accompanying amended EIT Regulation. The future SIA will also take into account the results of the broader public consultation on the future EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation ('Horizon 2020'), which was launched with the objective of obtaining stakeholder's views on how to make the EU research and innovation funding more effective.
The Commission has received 187 contributions to the consultation on the EIT, 134 of which were submitted via the online questionnaire, and the remaining 53 in the form of written contributions. Contributions were received from a wide range of stakeholder organisations representing in a balanced way the three strands of the knowledge triangle.

This year it was attracting more participants than ever before with more than 3000 people in the first day at the Cable factory in the harbour of Helsinki.
Slush offered three start-up tracks for companies of different stages, ranging from pitching for seed funding to recruiting new talent to fueling business growth. Among the early stage category – the lightweight batch – the Finnish start-up
Sharetribe
, hosted by the Helsinki Co-location Centre, pitched well and ended up in the top 20 round.
Running out of business cards
Other EIT ICT Labs supported start-ups chose to promote their ideas in the expo of stands and a good indicator of promising leads was that almost everyone was running out of business cards in the second day. - Thanks to EIT ICT Labs,
Quuppa
got excellent visibility towards investors and potential customers in SLUSH 2012. The event has barely ended and we've received already several emails and phone calls from customers who are eager to get our demo system!", said Kimmo Kalliola, CEO of Quuppa.
sQRmap
, one of the Italian start-ups who were able to attend SLUSH thanks to the support by the EIT ICT Labs business development programme was very content with the outcome: - Our product is already in the Italian market and now we are looking to grow in Europe. Pitching at SLUSH enabled me to meet with interested investors. With their funding support we are able to internationalize sQRmap", stated Diego Taglioni, one of the founders of sQRmap.
In the same category of more mature startups, so called middleweights, the Berlin based company
Panospective
got a lot of attention for their throwable panoramic camera ball and could leave with a significantly larger network of contacts.
Among the top four startups that made it to the finals were another throwable device – a microphone – by a Finnish startup Catchbox originating from Aalto University. Doggifit, a start-up from the VTT Technical Research Center of Finland, one of the core partners of EIT ICT Labs, was viewed as to have an idea with good business potential and a large customer base.

The Long Term Evolution 4G technology makes it fast and easy to remedy power outages
KIC InnoEnergy is the EIT Knowledge and Innovation Community that focuses on sustainable energies, and a European company fostering the integration of education, technology, business and entrepreneurship. Within the activities of CC Sweden, the node for Smart Grids and Storage within KIC InnoEnergy, the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) and Ericsson have collaborated to increase the reliability of electricity grids through the use of wireless information technology.
An innovative remedy to power outages
Power outages are a real problem for society. In news reports, they are usually illustrated by pictures of workers struggling in meter-deep snow to cut down trees that have fallen over the power lines.
Electricity networks will become ‘self-healing’. When a power line fails, or there is a short circuit in a substation, information about the problem can be transmitted, analyzed, and corrected automatically. Communication takes place directly between substations but also to the operations control center.
Professor Lars Nordström of KTH
Information technology cannot of course remove fallen trees, but the technique can locate the problem and carry out automatic switching in substations, so that power returns to affected customers quickly.
Problems that occur inside a substation can also be identified and rectified by means of wireless communication. As electricity travels from power plants to residential areas throughout Sweden, it passes through many thousands of substations and transformers. In rural areas, these are often remotely located. Therefore, the use of wireless of technology can save a great amount of time and resources.
This type of cooperation between ICT and energy systems is very valuable for us. The progress within communication technology constantly opens new areas of application. The fact that 4G technology can be used to manage and control the grid is beneficial for all of society.
Craig Donovan, Ericsson
The benefits of smart grids
A smart electricity grid will not only enable self-healing. Smart grids will also facilitate a constant exchange of information on supply and demand of electricity. Customers will be able, for example, to adjust their consumption according to the current price structure. With 4G, the transfer of information has reached the level required for operation and maintenance of critical infrastructure.
The transfer must be fast, reliable, secure and high quality. It also has to be accessible, geographically independent and follow a uniform standard.
Craig Donovan, Ericsson
Donovan says that the developments within mobile networks mean that the frequency band is divided into small segments or sub-carriers. The data can then be sent out simultaneously on different channels, which reduces the time for data transfer and increases capacity.
LTE offers a guarantee of quality and a future-proof uniform standard. With a clear roadmap for future improvements, such as LTE-Advanced, wireless broadband technology becomes applicable in areas with high demands on reliability and availability.
One interesting issue is whether large users, in this case the electricity distributors, need to build their own private networks, or if they can use the existing telecom operator networks.
Professor Lars Nordström of KTH
One thing they need to consider is the level of safety. In principle, it must be impossible for a malicious hacker to break into the system and disrupt the transmission of electricity.
Our tests show that existing mobile networks can be made secure against sabotage. Power companies could then use TeliaSonera or any other of the market’s mobile operators to provide wireless connectivity.
However, in some cases, power companies are likely to choose to invest in their own networks. In Australia, the energy company Ausgrid has engaged Ericsson to build a private LTE network.
The prototype
During 2011, a proof-of-concept demonstrator, using LTE technology for substation automation, has been developed and tested in a lab at KTH.
We have simulated a number of cases and found that the technology works. The information is transferred as predicted, and switching is done automatically in our substation models.
Professor Lars Nordström
The next step is to field-test the technology. This will be done at nine substations in Norra Djurgårdsstaden in Stockholm, located not far from KTH. Once that phase is completed, the technology may be mature enough for commercialization. The first potential customers are companies that own power grids and are responsible for the distribution of electricity between generators and consumers.
KIC InnoEnergy is the key enabler in this type of project. The partnership has been built on the strengths of both the department of Industrial Information & Control Systems at KTH and Ericsson.

The EIT's publication on practices emerging from its three current Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) is published.
The publication has been compiled to showcase the approach - its ‘what’ and its ‘how’ - taken by the EIT to catalyse the knowledge triangle (business, higher education and research) in Europe. The models of governance and the activities emerging from the Institute’s first three KICs are innovative and experimental and these experiences should be of particular interest to policy-makers, innovation practitioners and analysts, as well as to the new generation of potential future KICs.
The publication begins with an overview of the EIT, the KICs and their Co-location Centres (CLC), and presents their practices to foster innovation from all three sides of the knowledge triangle. Subsequent chapters highlight the emerging governance model of the KICs in more detail. They also analyse some of the practices of the EIT and the KICs in support of entrepreneurship and innovation. These include nurturing talent, bridging the innovation gap between ideas and the market and accelerating business development.

Building stronger synergies between research, innovation and education in European ICT.
An agreement bringing together EIT ICT Labs of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology and the EU's Future Internet Public-Private Partnership (FI-PPP) was signed on 21 June in the presence of Neelie Kroes, European Commission Vice-President for Digital Agenda, and Androulla Vassiliou, Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth.
The Memorandum of Collaboration lays down the principles for future collaboration between the two European initiatives aiming at building stronger synergies between research, innovation and education in the ICT sector. Aligning efforts and expertise in this way will generate important network effects, meaning more start-ups, more patents and more economic growth for Europe.
This agreement is a perfect example of the cooperation we want to develop between the EIT and other initiatives within Horizon 2020, the new EU programme for research and innovation. Combining EIT ICT Labs' talent and knowledge with the firepower of Future Internet PPP will enable us to deliver more effective results and to inspire the entrepreneurial leaders of tomorrow.
Commissioner Androulla Vassiliou
EIT ICT Labs is one of the Institute's three 'knowledge and innovation communities', which bring together top universities and research institutes with leading businesses across Europe, while the Future Internet PPP promotes the development of European-scale platforms for smart systems in areas such as transport, health and energy.
ICT is a driver for economic growth and increased quality of life. As ICT innovation players at the European level EIT ICT Labs and the Future Internet PPP join forces to bring these benefits to European citizens. EIT ICT Labs is proud to bring its ICT education and innovation skills to the table to jointly with the FI-PPP drive the uptake of future Internet technologies and services. Within FI PPP and EIT ICT Labs we both cover a multitude of shared objectives and have considerable diversity through the numerous projects and approaches conducive to innovation as such. Now it is time also to seek synergies and get aligned, both initiatives being such major investments in the European scale.
Prof. Willem Jonker, CEO of EIT ICT Labs. Mikko Riepula, Project Manager for the FI PPP support action CONCORD
The Future Internet PPP and EIT ICT Labs will focus on ICT infrastructure, entrepreneurship, business development, education and training. The agreement will also enable both parties to build on the results of Future Internet PPP projects in an effective way.
The signing ceremony took place in the Berlaymont offices of Vice-president Kroes in presence of Commissioner Vassiliou.

A team representing the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and KIC InnoEnergy competed in the finals of one of the world's leading business competitions in New York City on 26 April.
The five-strong team, who presented a project aimed at boosting the use of solar power in Africa, received a "good luck" message from EU Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth Commissioner, Androulla Vassiliou, on the eve of their participation in the anti-poverty HULT Global Case Challenge.
Thousands of students, representing over 130 countries and six continents, competed across five cities and online to reach the final, which took place at New York Public Library in the presence of former US President Bill Clinton and Nobel Peace Prize Winner Muhammad Yunus yesterday. The Clinton Global Initiative will receive $1 million (approximately €800 000) to implement the best project.
In her message to the team, Commissioner Vassiliou said:
"When creating the EIT, Europe wished to promote the innovation capacity of students like you so they can bring concrete answers to modern societal challenges. Your success in this competition is also a success for this new approach to innovation in Europe of which you are the first ambassadors."
Team spokesperson Vincenzo Capogna, 24, an Italian energy engineering graduate from La Sapienza University in Rome, said:
"The idea of our project is to eradicate kerosene in Africa by the end of the decade. Our aim is to launch a pilot in Kenya, where the market is ripe for solar lighting. In order to achieve this ambitious goal, the barriers to the mass adoption of this technology must be brought down. The greatest of these barriers is access to finance."
About the EIT KIC InnoEnergy team
Vincenzo and the other team members are all post-graduate students on the
SELECT Master
programme, an Erasmus Mundus double degree run by KTH Technical University in Stockholm and UPC (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya) in Barcelona. The course is sponsored by the European Union and one of the EIT's KICs:
KIC InnoEnergy
. The other team members are: Francesco Fuso Nerini, 24, an Italian environmental engineering graduate from Polimi (Politecnico di Milano); Eduardo Maria Appleyard (captain), 30, who studied mechanical engineering at McGill University (Montreal); Eric Bowler, 26, a mechanical engineering graduate from Purdue University (West Lafayette, Indiana); and Oisin Tummon, 24, who studied mechanical engineering at UCT University (Cape Town).

The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and KIC InnoEnergy have signed the 2012 Grant Agreement (G.A.). This agreement will see the further strengthening of KIC InnoEnergy activities during the course of 2012, namely the KIC’s education initiatives as well as technological innovation and enterprise development with the overall goal of promoting the development of renewable energy within the European Union.
José Manuel Leceta (EIT Director) and Diego Pavia (KIC InnoEnergy CEO) after the signature of the 2012 Grant Agreement
The agreement consists of a total investment of 155 million € into KIC InnoEnergy, out of which 32 million € are provided by the EIT and 122 million € by members of the KIC InnoEnergy Consortium, consisting of companies, research centers, universities and business schools*.
I am very pleased about the signing of the 2012 annual Grant Agreement with KIC InnoEnergy and I am looking forward to working together in ensuring the ambitious goals of the KIC are achieved.
José Manuel Leceta, EIT Director
The KIC aims to achieve tangible results that impact both the creation of products and services within existing companies in the Consortium as well as the creation of new entrepreneurial ventures and the training of new talents all in the field of sustainable energy. In short, KIC InnoEnergy’s overall objective are very much aligned to the EIT’s to promote a cultural change within the European innovation landscape in which universities, businesses and entrepreneurs generate innovation and jobs thus generating real tangible impact on society.
It is thus expected that by the end of 2012, KIC InnoEnergy will create 82 start-ups, 27 patents and 56 products and services as well train 450 new talents all within the specific field of sustainable energy. According to Diego Pavia, KIC InnoEnergy CEO,
This 2012 agreement is intended to be an enabler of innovation in sustainable energy from a global perspective in line with EU strategic objectives of achieving greater energy self-sufficiency in the EU.

Focus on the EIT ICT Labs winner of the 1st EIT Entrepreneurship Awards
Protecting a company or organisation against known cyber-security threats is one thing; protecting them against unknown cyber-threats is quite another.
But that is exactly the goal of
Trifense
, a Technical University of Berlin spin-out named as the
EIT ICT Labs
winner of the EIT Awards. Trifense is working together with EIT ICT Labs in one of their thematic action lines: “Future media and content delivery” and they provide innovative security solutions. Working closely with the KIC has been proven useful to Trifense and the venture is benefiting from connections with people from different backgrounds.
A self-learning technology
A modern society can be vulnerable to pretty huge threats. Our technology can address this appropriately. It is crucial for governments, operators of critical infrastructures such as utilities, and companies in all sorts of sectors from financial services to healthcare to be able to detect such risks and protect themselves against them.
Trifense Managing Director and Co-founder Patrick Duessel
Trifense’s self-learning technology allows models of “normality” to be learnt through incoming data known as network packet payloads. In this way, any deviation from the models can de detected and unknown cyber-threats entangled with the payloads can be recognised. The main difference between this and more traditional technology is that Trifense does not rely on any kind of pre-written description of the attack to spot the trouble coming.
This is a significant advantage over traditional network security solutions such as firewalls or signature-based systems.
Patrick Duessel
Services trusted by the German government
Duessel is also encouraged by the interest from the German government.
IT security has a very high priority right now, and German politicians believe in the idea of Trifense. They take it seriously.
Patrick Duessel
Proof is in the awards that Trifense has picked up. For example, in 2010 it won a competition funded by the Federal Ministry for Economy and Technology for founders of innovative ICT companies, known as the ‘Gruenderwettbewerb IKT Innovativ’. In November 2011, the company was chosen for another ministry-supported initiative, the German Silicon Valley Accelerator programme. As a result of that selection, Duessel gets to spend a few months in early 2012 in Silicon Valley and seek out business opportunities there.
All this means that Duessel’s efforts are very much concentrated on developing and marketing the business, while the ongoing technology research is left to his colleagues. “I’d love to spend more time on the technical side. After all I’m a computer scientist,” says Duessel. “But it’s really interesting to get a company up and running. I wouldn’t want to miss out on this experience.”
The technology
The TRIFENSE technology utilises sophisticated machine learning for the effective, signature-free detection of cyber attacks in multi-gigabit computer networks. Its self-learning anomaly detection engine extracts and compares features from complex network data streams against previously trained data models.
Unlike current anomaly-based approaches that use only descriptive characteristics such as packet header information our approach monitors the actual payload of inbound network packets instead. Thus, the attacker is no longer able to hide attacks within the data stream.
Trifense being one of the winners of the EIT Awards shows the growing importance of security solutions in the digital society. I hope that this European level recognition will give an additional boost to the further development of Trifense.

The EIT has today published the Selection Criteria for the EIT’s 2014 Call for KICs.
The EIT spurs innovation and entrepreneurship across the European Union. To further enhance its impact and to incentivise the innovations needed to meet new societal challenges, the EIT will gradually expand its portfolio of Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) from 2014 to 2020.
As established in the EIT’s Strategic Innovation Agenda (SIA) and Horizon 2020, the first two new KICs, to be established in 2014, will address the thematic fields of:
Innovation for healthy living and active ageing; and
Raw materials: sustainable exploration, extraction, processing, recycling and substitution.
The first step in the process leading up to the designation of the new KICs in December 2014 is the publication of the Selection Criteria. These criteria build on the principles set in the EIT Regulation and the EIT's core values of impact, excellence and partnership. Aligned with the EIT's mission, these criteria will ensure that the designated KICs have all the elements that make a KIC a KIC.
The EIT will then publish the Framework of Guidance, the EIT Financial Rules and the EIT Principles for financing, monitoring and evaluating KIC activities in January 2014 followed by the launch of the Call on 14 February 2014.

Alexander von Gabain, Chairman of the EIT Governing Board
Under the new EU Horizon 2020 for research and innovation, adopted today by the European Parliament, the EIT’s budget will significantly increase. The EIT will receive €2.7 billion for 2014-2020, 3.5% of the overall EU research and innovation budget. This represents a significant increase from the initial EIT start-up budget, which was around €300 million for 2008 to 2013. The funds will strengthen the EU's research and innovation capacity and contribute to growth and the creation of new jobs.
The EIT comes under the responsibility of Androulla Vassiliou, European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth, who described the vote as "a massive boost for European research and the entrepreneurs of tomorrow".
With the European Institute of Innovation and Technology and the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, Europe is seriously investing in people who have the knowledge and talent to innovate and change lives. This is excellent news for the research community and the EIT's entrepreneurs of tomorrow.
Commissioner Vassiliou.
As part of its plans for the next seven years, the EIT will set up new Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) in the thematic fields of innovation for healthy living and active ageing, raw materials, food for future, added value manufacturing and urban mobility. In addition, the EIT will continue to work closely together with its existing three KICs (Climate-KIC, EIT ICT Labs and KIC InnoEnergy) to strengthen their activities. The EIT and its KICs will continue to share their novel approach to innovation through dissemination and outreach activities. In particular, the Regional Innovation Scheme will foster innovation across the Union by allowing partnerships of higher education institutions, research organisations, companies and other innovation stakeholders to collaborate closely with KICs.

17 innovators nominated
The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) today celebrates innovation and entrepreneurship in Europe with a conference that will culminate with the announcement of the winners of the EIT Awards 2013.
For the Venture Award, which puts the spotlight on breakthrough innovations and exciting start-ups, the following eight nominees have been selected by the EIT’s Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs): Chokri Moussaoui (Eternal Sun), David Tacconi (CoReHab), Dominik Peus (Antaco), Fabio Belloni (Quuppa), Héctor Martín (Smalle Technologies), Lars Wallden (Northstar Telemetrics), Lionel Chaverot (Enerstone) and Peter Stein (GreenTEG). This award was previously known as the EIT Entrepreneurship Award and was first launched in 2012.
Nine change agents have been nominated for the EIT’s new CH.A.N.G.E (Change Agents and Next Generation Entrepreneurs) Award, which showcases the ideas of young entrepreneurs of the future that are emerging from education and training programmes at the EIT. The nine nominees for this award are David Pribil (Heart-Guard), Dorottya Maksay (Homebuddy), Eduardo Appleyard (Solar Lighting for Africa), Evan Bruner (SolarCatch), Germán Leiva (JukeBoss), Kate Hofman (GrowUp), Linkesh Diwan (Wise Earth Technology), Muhammad Rizwan Awan (Chimney Sheet) and Swati Pandey (TRA Labs).
Supporting the creation of an entrepreneurial culture in Europe is a key objective of the EIT. It means fostering a change in mindset and encouraging (calculated) risk-taking attitudes. To help realise its objective, the EIT organises an annual award competition that showcases entrepreneurial ideas and that puts the spotlight on entrepreneurial talent from its three KICs.
“Europe needs many more of the kind of brilliant entrepreneurs that have shaped our history. Innovators and entrepreneurs are important for our jobs, economies, societies and lives,” said Alexander von Gabain, Chairman of the Governing Board of the EIT. “The EIT Awards let us put the spotlight on new ideas that can become products and services, and on students and researchers that will be the entrepreneurs and innovators of tomorrow.”
Naveen Jain, Founder of the Moon Express, inome and World Innovation Institute, will inspire participants at the EIT Awards event to act on their sense of entrepreneurialism to help launch innovative solutions to the significant challenges our world faces.
“We are living in one of most innovative decades in the human history even though many will have us believe that our best days are behind us. Advances in technology will allow us to solve many of the grand challenges facing us today such as the lack of clean water, lack of affordable healthcare, obsolete education system and insufficient clean energy. We need to change our mindset from scarcity to abundance and realise that long term sustainability doesn’t come from conservation but from creation,” Jain said.
Launched in 2012, the EIT Awards highlight the ideas and start ups that are coming out of the EIT’s KICs. Every year, each of the KICs (
Climate-KIC
,
EIT ICT Labs
and

"The outstanding factor behind the decision was the potential of the winners to create innovations needed to address critical challenges for today’s societies. EIT Health and EIT Raw Materials are excellent partnerships that will generate impact, in terms of growth and job creation, which are at the heart of the Europe 2020 Strategy and President Juncker’s Commission top priorities,” said Martin Kern, EIT Interim Director.
Winners bring pan-European impact
InnoLife
– winner of
EIT Health
(healthy living and active ageing) – is a consortium of more than 50 partners (and in addition 90 associate organisations) of leading businesses, research centres and universities from 9 EU countries, including Abbott Laboratories from Spain, the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research (Inserm) and the University of Oxford from the UK. Dr. Ursula Redeker from Roche Diagnostics GmbH, the key coordinating partner, said “We are thrilled to win the EIT’s call. Our partnership’s goal is to promote entrepreneurship and develop innovations in healthy living and active ageing, providing Europe with new opportunities and resources. We will achieve this by delivering products, services and concepts that will improve quality of life and contribute to the sustainability of healthcare across Europe. Our partners represent top excellence and our outreach activities will spread all over Europe. By 2018, we are aiming to create, among others, 70 start-ups per year and have 1 000 000 students participating in our educational online programmes per year.”

spent time visiting the IMECAL factory in Valencia on Tuesday, where they learnt about the pilot plant and its bioethanol generation. Over the course of the rest of the week, they visited the University of Valencia’s Tarongers campus, where they enjoyed workshops in financing a start-up, marketing and communications and of course valuable time to work on their cleantech business ideas.
Blogging students
Summer school students Anna Klobut – student studying Transportation and Environmental Engineering at Aalto University in Finland, and Anastasia Nikologianni – a PhD student studying at Birmingham University – have written about their #Journey2014 experiences so far on the
Climate-KIC Blog
last week.
“Here in Valencia our programme consists of lectures from business, and entrepreneurship, to marketing, and finance. My background is in engineering and I haven’t taken any business courses before, so there is a lot of new information to process each day,”
says Ana
.
“One of the key things that I have learned so far is that if you are planning to found a start-up and become an entrepreneur, the most important thing to find out is if there is a market for your product. A start-up can only be successful if it has the right market and people want to buy your product. It doesn’t matter if you have a brilliant product, if no one buys it , you have no business. It’s as simple as that.”
Anastasia, a Greek PhD student studying at Birmingham University, writes about the
challenges they face when coming up with a business idea
.
“We are now at the stage where ideas have to face the reality. Spending the last few days doing market research at the streets of Berlin, contacting companies, producing questionnaires and trying to understand if our business plan will be a success or not, made us realise that research, time planning, accuracy and hard work is needed, ”
she writes
.
“Although, the process in not easy and the fact that we are all coming through difficulties during the day, the support from the group is tremendous. Working together with our coaches, but also using our own expertise we manage to evaluate our projects and be critical about their future.”

The European Union has played a key role in brokering today’s historic agreement in Paris, where 195 countries adopted the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate deal.
Image
What is being described as an ambitious and balanced agreement is the first major multilateral deal of the 21st century. It sets out a global action plan to put the world on track to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2°C.
The deal is the culmination of years of efforts by the international community to bring about a universal multilateral agreement on climate change.
Following limited participation in the Kyoto Protocol and the lack of agreement in Copenhagen in 2009, the European Union has been building a broad coalition of developed and developing countries in favour of high ambition that shaped the successful outcome of the Paris summit.
Clear signal
The Paris Agreement sends a clear signal to investors, businesses, and policy-makers that the global transition to clean energy is here to stay and resources have to shift away from polluting fossil fuels.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said: “Today the world is united in the fight against climate change. Today the world gets a lifeline, a last chance to hand over to future generations a world that is more stable, a healthier planet, fairer societies and more prosperous economies.”
Bertrand van Ee, CEO of Climate-KIC, the EU’s main climate innovation initiative, said: “President Obama ended his speech at the opening of the COP21 climate change summit with ‘Let’s get to work.’ I would now like to recall those words on the day of the historic Paris Agreement. Business faces the choice, either to shape the needs and impacts of a zero carbon future, or to be shaped by it.”
“The deal struck in Paris today has unlocked a blue ocean of uncontested opportunities for business. The trajectory of staying well below two degrees warming is achievable, but achieving it requires a major shift in the global economy. That shift represents a highly lucrative economic opportunity. Already, there’s a $5.5 trillion market for low carbon technologies and products. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg,” said van Ee.
An armoury of silver bullets
Van Ee added: “A single silver bullet will not be sufficient to bring about the systemic change required. We need an armoury of silver bullets to transform how we live, what we consume, and how we do business.”
Climate-KIC has already spawned a range of those cutting-edge innovations, from climate change mitigation technologies, such as carbon negative power technology Cogent Heat Energy Storage Systems (CHESS), through to Aqysta, a hydro-powered irrigation pump that can double crop yields in developing countries, without using any fuel or electricity. Last year 40 Climate-KIC start-ups won funding of over €1 million, with one entrepreneur, tado°, winning €10 million.
EU Climate Action and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete said:  “This agreement is a major win for Europe. But more importantly, it is a major win for the global community. Europe has led the efforts in Paris to get an ambitious and legally binding global climate deal.”
“We succeeded. Now, what has been promised must be delivered. Europe will continue to lead the global low-carbon transition we have agreed,” Cañete said.
Last week, newly released research from Climate-KIC revealed that most European business leaders have prepared strategies to respond to climate change, but with a lack of focus on innovation. As a result, those strategies are likely to be ineffective for a 2°C trajectory.
The Paris climate deal
The Paris climate change agreement is a bridge between today’s policies and climate-neutrality before the end of the century. In Paris, governments agreed on ambition, commitment, and solidarity.
Ambition:
Governments agreed a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to aim to limit the increase to 1.5°C, since this would significantly reduce risks and the impacts of climate change. The agreement calls for global emissions to peak as soon as possible, recognising that this will take longer for developing countries and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with the best available science.
Before and during the Paris conference, countries submitted comprehensive national climate action plans to reduce their emissions. The sum total of the 185 intended nationally determined contributions prepared in advance of the Paris conference are not yet enough to keep the world below 2°C by the end of the century. However, the agreement traces the way to achieving this target.
Commitment:
To achieve this common ambition, governments agreed to come together every 5 years to set more ambitious targets as required by science. They also accepted to report to each other and the public on how well they are doing to implement their targets, to ensure transparency and oversight. A global stocktake will take place every five years. A robust transparency and accountability system will track progress towards the long-term goal.
Solidarity:
The EU and other developed countries will continue to support climate action to reduce emissions and build resilience to climate change impacts in developing countries. Other countries are encouraged to provide or continue to provide such support voluntarily. Continued and enhanced international support for adaptation will be provided to developing countries.  Developed countries intend to continue their existing collective goal to mobilise USD 100 billion per year until 2025 when a new collective goal will be set.
Loss and Damage
The Paris Agreement also features a standalone article dealing with the issue of loss and damage associated with the impacts of climate change. Countries also acknowledge the need to cooperate and enhance the understanding, action and support in different areas such as early warning systems, emergency preparedness and risk insurance.
Lima-Paris Action Agenda
The Lima-Paris Action Agenda, an initiative of the Peruvian and French COP Presidencies aimed at catalysing multi-stakeholder action, brought an unprecedented number of countries, cities, businesses and civil society members together on a global stage to accelerate cooperative climate action in support of the new agreement.
The initiative demonstrated that the world is ready to catalyse efforts into climate action even before the Paris agreement enters into force in 2020. A number of major announcements and ground breaking initiatives were presented during the two week conference.

Hans Joachim ‘John’ Schellnhuber, Climate-KIC’s chairman and director of Climate-KIC partner the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) says the global climate deal reached in Paris last night “is a turning point in the human enterprise.”
Image
He said: “The spirits of Paris have defeated the ghosts of Copenhagen! Reason and moral combined at the COP21 to deliver a historical climate agreement that finally transcends national egotisms. The target of limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees and aiming at 1.5 degrees is more ambitious than expected, yet fully in line with the scientific risk assessment.”
Schellnhuber added: “If sincerely operationalised, the Paris agreement will induce the decarbonisation of the world economy by the middle of this century. The current emissions reduction pledges (INDCs) of most countries, however, are insufficient and have to be adapted to the new level of ambition in the next few years. Still, this is a turning point in the human enterprise where the great transformation towards sustainability begins.”

Research from Climate-KIC reveals that most European business leaders have prepared strategies to respond to climate change, but with a lack of focus on innovation, those strategies are likely to be ineffective for a 2°C trajectory.
The study from Climate-KIC, the EU’s principal knowledge and innovation community focused on climate change is entitled,
Sparking an Innovation Step Change
.  It analyses the readiness of C-level European business leaders to deploy radical innovation to turn climate change from a threat into an opportunity.
Most European business leaders, (63%) acknowledge the regulatory and physical risks posed by climate change.  63% also believe responding to climate change would drive growth as demand for environmentally sound products and services increases.  To address the identified risk and opportunity, most businesses (59%) said they have a strategy to respond to climate change.
However, despite the positive ambitions of European business, only 3 in 10 (29%) see a large amount of scope to respond to climate change using innovative technologies and ways of working.  Even less (14%) believe there is a large amount of scope to evolve their business model to reduce resource consumption and carbon emissions.
An even more concerning insight was that irrespective of climate change, over a third (35%) of respondents concluded that their market is not subject to external changes, so they do not need to incorporate any form of innovation.
Speaking from the Paris launch of the study, Bertrand van Ee, Chief Executive, Climate-KIC, said: “Innovation has played a critical role in most socioeconomic revolutions.  Climate change is no exception.  The science shows we need to reconfigure the economy in-line with the 2°C trajectory – and innovation must sit at the centre of the transition.
“Many businesses seem to have forgotten how to innovate, or are delaying innovation until they get a policy silver bullet.  That strategy doesn’t reflect business’ understanding of the risks of climate change; or the realistic timelines to scale up radical innovations to turn the threat into an opportunity,” he said.
Research & Development (R&D) departments are the critical business function for identifying and responding to the needs of the changing marketplace, so they were a key focus of the Climate-KIC study.  Despite climate change appearing clearly on boardroom risk registers, R&D departments were found to lack the skills and resources to meet the challenges of a carbon constrained world.
•Less than 4 in 10 (38%) of R&D departments have sufficient expertise to respond to climate change
•Most firms (29%) invest between 10-20% of their budget in R&D, but nearly two-thirds (63%) only dedicate 5% or less of their R&D budget to innovation to respond to climate change
•1 in 10 (11%) dedicate none of their budget to responding to climate change
Whilst R&D departments were the ‘least worst’ at understanding how to respond to climate change, the research also highlighted a severe lack of skills in other key business functions.
•Only 10% of accounting and finance teams, which are critical to forming corporate strategy, have climate change expertise
•6% of Human Resources departments; i.e. those responsible for hiring personnel with skills to respond to climate change, understand it
The research also explored the barriers that have led to the addiction to incrementalism, as well as potential solutions to break that cycle.  There was a clear signal to the COP21 negotiators that business needs the certainty to internalise the challenge of climate change in order to apply innovation to responding: only 3 in 10 (30%) said climate change regulation encouraged them to develop new innovation to respond to climate change.
Given the global scale of the climate challenge, the study explored the role of industry collaboration for enabling businesses to tackle common carbon-related issues.
•Two-thirds (65%) believe EU-level competition law has limited industry’s ability to collaborate and respond to climate change
•A third (33%) believe sharing costs and resources to improve efficiency and reduce emissions would enable them to respond effectively
•32% believe sharing the results of tests and best practice related to improving efficiency and reducing emissions could enable them to respond effectively
Paul Simpson, CEO, CDP, which contributed to the Climate-KIC report, said: “Most companies, especially in the commodities space, cannot be seen to discuss or share ideas amongst themselves on carbon pricing as they could be called out for price fixing.  Corporate law has been designed to prevent monopolies, but it can hold back sustainability.  In my view, business needs to first collaborate to create a sustainable system – then compete.”
Climate-KIC’s experience as Europe’s largest collaboration community on climate change is that greater sharing of information can actually raise more competition, not limit it.  The willingness of business to collaborate is a clear opportunity to evolve policy to encourage greater diffusion of radical innovation to address climate change.
Bertrand van Ee, Chief Executive, Climate-KIC, added: “Business has a choice, either to shape the needs and impacts of a zero carbon future, or to be shaped by it.  Education is needed to equip business leaders with the knowledge and skills to shift them to a larger, “system-level” approach.  Business must actively place themselves on an innovation journey; creating channels for radical innovation to flow into their operations, making them more resilient and equipped to seize first mover advantage.”
Scientists estimate that by deploying technologies business can potentially reduce the emissions intensity of industry by approximately 25%, with innovation reducing this by up to another 20 percent, before technological limits are approached in some energy-intensive sectors.

The weekend culminated with the teams pitching their completed business plans to the jury teams in each city. The atmosphere was one of nervous excitement as 54 hours of work was put under intense scrutiny by the judges, whose experiences starting their own businesses gave them the unique ability to spot potential pitfalls in the startups.
The winners were announced in a closing ceremony on Sunday evening. The startup teams took to the stage, each allowed five minutes to sell their idea to the judges. Questions on market analysis, legislation restrictions and perceived scalability kept the contestants working hard to win the judges over even after the pitch was made. In the end, it was the startup teams with the best ideas, backed up with well-rounded research and knowledge of customer needs, who scooped the top prizes.

YEAR: 2015
Ideas are the oxygen of growth in the zero carbon economy, and organisations need to be fed with these big, scalable, commercially-viable ideas to be able to address climate change. Climate-KIC – the European Union’s Knowledge and Innovation Community for climate innovation – has been doing this so successfully, that some in Australia and New Zealand are now keen to set up their own version.
At the
COP21 climate change summit
in December, the EU will be pushing for a binding deal that commits countries around the world to phase out fossil fuels and reduce carbon emissions. Leading up to the summit, some of the continent’s leading innovators are spreading the word around the world about the unprecedented opportunity to create a prosperous zero carbon future, driven by innovation, jobs, and investment.
Climate-KIC’s international ambassador is one of them. Former CEO and professor emeritus
Mary Ritter
has already been visiting Australia for many years to visit family. “It has been concerning to see the climate change challenge increase in Australia, in a region that is particularly hard hit by rising temperatures and extreme weather events. But during my more recent visits it has been inspiring to witness a real cultural shift towards opportunity and positive action,” she said.

The Nuon Solar Team from Climate-KIC partner Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands recently won the World Solar Chalenge, a 3000 km race with solar-powered cars across Australia.
Climate-KIC down under
Ritter is leading the development of a possible Climate-KIC ‘down under’ with businesses, universities and the government sector since late 2014. “We need to engage internationally, climate change is a global problem. A zero carbon economy can bring major benefits not only to Europe but to other parts of the world as well,” she says.
Following almost four years at the helm as CEO at Climate-KIC from 2010, Ritter was in Australia at the end of 2014 in her new capacity as international ambassador, to meet with Climate-KIC partner Suncorp. “The idea began to germinate that perhaps we should think about being ambitious in the Australasian region, start discussions about setting up an entity that’s similar to Climate-KIC in Europe.” Ritter can also draw on years of academic experience at Imperial College London, including as pro rector for international affairs.
Almost 100 meetings later, Ritter says the response has been overwhelmingly positive. But it is now time to “see if we can transform that enthusiasm into reality,” she says. “We are looking to identify a dozen or so core partners, and then in early 2016 we hope to take some hard decisions about strategy, with the launch of initial activities later in the year.”
Climate-KIC is supported by the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), a body of the European Union.
Secret ingredient
Climate-KIC’s secret ingredient is the right balance of business, research and innovation. It is this mix that enables Climate-KIC to generate transformative new innovations and business models. Its European network of universities, businesses and public bodies is the catalyst for bringing them into fruition, and Ritter has been working hard to bring together a similar group of partners in Australia and New Zealand.
“I am working with an excellent core team to organise local partners for the new partnership. Last month, we brought together people from across all sectors in key locations such as Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne,” she said. Ritter is being assisted by Greg Morrison, a recently-appointed professor in sustainable cities at
Curtin University
in Perth, who has previously worked with Climate-KIC in Europe.
With Australia’s new Prime Minister, Malcom Turnbull, putting innovation and start-ups right at the centre of his government’s policy, “the time is ripe” for an entrepreneurial approach for finding solutions to key societal problems such as climate change with “co-benefits for the economy” says Ritter, who says the first activities could kick-off as early as mid-2016.
“The last time I was there everyone had a real smile on their face and they were really excited about being able to do something – to innovate. I think the momentum leading up to the global climate change summit COP21, and onwards into 2016 is something very strong,” stressed Ritter.
Disruptive technologies
One of the first Climate-KIC programmes that could be launched in Australia is the
Climate-KIC Accelerator
, which helps start-ups to bring their disruptive clean-tech ideas to market faster through coaching, mentoring and funding, and exposure to big business partners. In Europe, the programme is the largest accelerator of its kind with centres in major cities such as Berlin, London and Paris.
The programme is hugely successful in Europe. Last year alone, 64 start-ups with ideas to tackle climate change collectively raised over €68 million (AUS$ 104 million) through external funding. Hundreds of start-ups are currently enrolled in the programme.
A recent success is
Nerdalize
, a Dutch start-up company that was awarded the title of Europe’s best climate venture last month. The start-up, which heats buildings with computing power, has teamed up with major utility company Eneco in the Netherlands to conduct field tests.
The Nerdalize concept puts servers in consumers’ homes to be used as radiators, and connects them through the internet, creating a huge decentralised data centre. Companies and institutions that require a lot of processing power can reduce their costs in the area of accommodation and cooling of datacentres up to 55 per cent with the concept developed by Nerdalize.
Back in 2013, Climate-KIC already supported — and still works with — French start-up
Qarnot Computing
, the pioneer of this emerging, fast-growing field. This is a great example of how Climate-KIC works with market leaders, while also supporting new players and helping them develop the concept further towards new sectors.
It is this kind of clean-tech success, coupling environmental benefits with economic advantages, that Ritter hopes the new partnership can help deliver in Australia and New Zealand.
Next generation of climate leaders
Another Climate-KIC initiative that could soon be deployed down under is
The Journey
summer school. The course brings together students from across disciplines and gives them a crash ‘learning  by doing’ course in entrepreneurship, following an introduction to the science of climate change. In just five weeks, while journeying between several top-level universities, businesses and public bodies such as city councils across Europe, students create real business ideas for start-ups – and many of these are now thriving.
Students in Australia and New Zealand already participated in Climate-KIC’s
Climathon
earlier this year. During the global 24-hour event, teams around the world tried to hack a local city-focussed climate change challenge. In New Zealand’s capital, students developed an online solution to help reduce Wellington’s transport demands. The team was selected by a jury to present their solution at an event set to be hosted by Climate-KIC during the UN climate change summit in Paris next month.
In Europe, Climate-KIC addresses climate change across four priority themes: urban areas, land use, production systems, decision metrics and finance. Education is at the heart of these themes to inspire and empower the next generation of climate leaders.
In Australia, “as everywhere,” cities will certainly also be one of the big priorities, says Ritter. Nowhere is the climate change challenge more pressing than in cities. In 2015, some 70 per cent of the world’s population lives and works in cities, accounting for 80 per cent of energy consumption. “In addition to that the agricultural sector is going to be very important, and also coastlines as most of the major cities are on the coast.”
Partners that are currently involved in the discussions led by Ritter are based in the Australian cities Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, Canberra, Perth – and Wellington, New Zealand’s capital.
Extreme weather
The immediate climate challenges faced by Australasians are not always the same as in Europe – or the same across Australia or New Zealand for that matter. “In Brisbane it’s very much cyclones, flooding and extreme weather events that are a priority,” says Ritter. “But in Canberra, a lot of work is focussed on renewable energy and diversification of the economy.”
There would be ample opportunities for collaboration between the European and Australasian partnerships, says Ritter. Extreme events such as cyclones, flooding and bushfires could offer one area where the organisations could team up. Suncorp, one of Australia’s largest financial services companies, is already a partner in Climate-KIC’s
Open Access Catastrophe Model
(OASIS) project. OASIS creates computer models to predict financial losses as a result of catastrophes.
Another area for collaboration could be the testing of new technologies in so called ‘living labs’, which Climate-KIC conducts through its
Building Technologies Accelerator
. Living labs are buildings to test technology prototypes in real-life environments. “If you wanted to test in tropical or subtropical situations, Australia would certainly offer that,” said Ritter. Efficiencies in the construction market have the potential to radically reduce carbon emissions.
In Perth, the focus in on cities, but also on how they connect with their rural environment. “In Western Australia, communities are very isolated. So there’s interesting work to be done on micro grids,” says Ritter. “Also, innovation in the way land is used for agricultural purposes is very much on the agenda in several of the south eastern states” she said.
In the next couple of months a group of core partners will be confirmed, says Ritter: “Several organisations from the public, academic and business sectors have expressed intent to join.”

KICs develop innovative products and services, foster new business, encourage growth and train a new generation of entrepreneurs. They address focused innovation topics and integrate public and private research organisations, innovative industries, higher education institutions, investors, start-ups and spin-offs into unprecedented networks combining the diverse competencies needed to make innovation happen.
The first three KICs were designated in December 2009: Climate-KIC, EIT Digital and KIC InnoEnergy.  As an integral part of Horizon2020, the EU Programme for Research and Innovation, the EIT expanded its activities in 2014 with the designation of EIT Health and EIT Raw Materials. A new Call for KICs proposals will be launched in January 2016 to designate EIT Food and EIT Manufacturing in November 2016.
Background
About the selection process of new EIT Governing Board members
The selection process for the identification of the four new appointed EIT Governing Board members will start with a call for expression of interest to be published in November 2015. Following this, the Steering will prepare a shortlist of individuals to be proposed as members of the EIT Governing Board. The Governing Board will transmit the shortlist to the European Commission for the formal appointment of the four new EIT Governing Board members.
On the basis of this proposal, the European Commission will send a report summarising the selection process and its results to the Council and the European Parliament, who have a period of one month to take cognisance of the outcome of the selection process. The four new members of the Governing Board will then be nominated by a European Commission Decision expected in summer 2016.

YEAR: 2015
Interview with Govinda Upadhyay, winner of the
EIT Change Award 2015
and
finalist in the Forbes Under 30 Change the World Competition
Hello Govinda. It’s been almost six months since you won the 2015 EIT Change Award.
What did it change for you?
First of all, it brought us a lot of credibility and confidence. It also gave us more visibility than we were expecting. For example, we started getting emails from different places in Europe, like Germany, France and Slovenia, from people who wanted to find out more about our project and how they could bring it to their country. It made us realise that we really needed to pump things up.
What impact did winning the EIT Change Award have on your business start-up, LEDSafari?
We had to expand our team. We were just a bunch of students and we realised we had to go full-time. We also got a business coach, Mukul Kumar, from the EIT’s Climate-KIC (Knowledge and innovation Community). He was very happy with our work and agreed to become our CEO. He also gave us a lot of confidence in what we were doing.
Image
When you started, how many students were involved?
It started with basically just me as part of the KIC InnoEnergy, when I was doing my Master’s in Sustainable Energy Engineering in Stockholm and Eindhoven. I then moved to Switzerland for my PhD and two of my friends joined, Elisa Wepfer and Naomi Savioz.
So things then started to accelerate fairly quickly?
It was not so quick. We also decided to make a key change in our strategy. Typical start-up syndrome! Our initial idea was to provide lamps to everyone who didn’t have a light, particularly in developing or emerging economies. But then, as things started to evolve, we realised we didn’t just want to sell people a lamp, we wanted to teach them how to make the lamp.
We decided that we should focus on children in schools, especially the 10-15 age group. We got immediate interest from Swiss schools, who were eager to learn about the project as an educational tool. We started to think in terms of every student having the same basic needs, whether they come from a western economy or developing country. Everyone appreciates a practical and interactive education, not just the theory. We want them to learn something practical, so they can make the lamp and use it for hiking, in the garden or for studying, for example.
The demand has now really taken off, so much so that I decided a couple of weeks ago that I should stop my PhD to work full time on the LEDsafari project. I know I have to focus on this properly or it won’t work. The whole scenario has changed now, it’s a different ball-game.
Did winning the EIT award in May help you to attract new investors?
It’s a bit too soon for that in concrete terms, but we are targeting foundations and impact investors. We want to be a lean business. We want to ensure all our operations run as smoothly as possible. Anyone can come to us from any country in the world. We train their trainers so that they can spread in their respective country. We sell both the lamps and the training. So say an organization involved with schools in Belgium contacts us, we will offer to train the trainers and then these trainers can implement the LEDSafari project in the schools.
How is the lamp actually powered?
Image
It’s very simple really. The USP of LEDSafari was to make a lamp in a simplified way. We’re using just a few components: a solar panel, a small battery, a switch and a LED bulb. These components are chosen to ensure that the lamps are simple to make but fully functional. It took us a year to optimise all the components. The idea is that, through the lamp, we can educate children about sustainability, about solar, about energy technology and recycling because our lamp is made from recycled materials. We are now introducing sensor-based lamps, based on the same make-it-yourself principle. We are also in the process of introducing 3D printing which will allow people to design their own lamp before fitting in the components.
We wanted to do more than just create a lamp - we wanted to create something visionary. Right now, we are also building a LEDSafari app as an e-learning tool through which students can exchange design ideas, stay engaged in the process of development and create a community. The fact that smartphones have become much cheaper now means that more people can take advantage of this app all over the world.
The students can also use this app to measure their own impact. This is basically a quantification of their action in terms of the energy and money saved by using a solar powered lamp, as well as CO2 saved, hence making them more environmentally conscious people. We believe that this can help our future generation to be better prepared to handle climate change and to be pro-active in making the world a better place.
So now you’re going to sell a complete lamp-kit, with the lamp materials, the training and the app?
Exactly. We are still developing the app but the idea is indeed to sell the lamp components, training and the app together.
How much does that cost altogether?
We don’t have a single unit price. So, for example, in the EU and the developed world, we sell the kit for 30 euros. In developing countries, it would be more like 10-15 euros. We believe everybody has a right to this kit, so in cases where somebody can’t pay, we look for help from partners to subsidise the cost.
What is your current turnover?
It’s hard to say for this year because we’ve just got going. But for 2016, we would need 1-1.5 million euros as investment. We aim to be fully profitable by 2018. That’s our goal. We would like to reach 1 million students in the next two years. This will require an investment of 10 million euros and a network of financial and implementation partners with the same vision.
You recently won a prestigious US prize from Forbes magazine. Can you tell us more about that?
Sure. It was a contest called the Under 30 $1M Change the World Competition organised by Forbes magazine. The EIT actually encouraged us to enter the competition. Forbes liked us and invited us over to Philadelphia. There were more than 2,500 applications from all over the world. We made it to the final and received $100,000 in prize money from the Pratt Foundation. They told us they loved our project and our unique approach, which was very nice to hear. It was an amazing event – with an audience of 2,000 young entrepreneurs handpicked by Forbes from all over the world. I was really struck by the energy and enthusiasm levels there. We spoke to a lot of people and it certainly encouraged us to look at the US market.
Image
What will you do with the prize money?
We’re going to invest it back into the company.
You have taken part in various EIT Community programmes, including the KIC InnoEnergy Master Programme and Climate-KIC Innovate4Climate Accelerator. What for you is the most important facet of the EIT?
That’s right. The KIC InnoEnergy Master programme was one year at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm and a year at the Eindhoven Technical University (TU/e). I then went onto the Climate-KIC Innovate4Climate Accelerator in Zurich.
What I really like about the EIT is its openness and its combination of education and entrepreneurship. I don’t think any other programme in the world provides that. That’s pretty cool. The EIT network is also really important. They are always able to come up with the name of someone who can help you. If you don't have this network, you cannot grow.
Is Europe’s education system giving young people the right skills for the future? Are the EIT educational programmes you took part in different from other educational programmes you came across?
I was lucky, but I’m not sure whether traditional programmes can help young people go on to become entrepreneurs. But if you adapt these courses, as they have with the KICs, then why not? The EIT programmes are certainly different. I had options to go to other universities but I wanted to follow the EIT courses. They’re really practical. You work on your project, it’s not like working in the lab. They help you think beyond your specific background.
What advice would you give to young people interested in the EIT?
I was 22 when I started my Master’s in Stockholm. My advice to people is that don’t think you are too young to do things. Go crazy and just do it. Don’t wait for the right moment to come. The world is moving fast and you need to catch up. Use the network and tools that the EIT provides.
In your view, is Europe innovation-friendly? If you could give one piece of practical advice to other innovators and entrepreneurs in Europe, what would it be?
That’s a difficult one. In Europe, perhaps investors are looking more for something established. I think the US is more open in this respect, it’s at a different level. My advice to other innovators and entrepreneurs is to believe in yourself, even when people are saying your idea is crap. Even if things are moving slowly, there will come a point when you start to go faster. It’s very easy with a start-up to get depressed and stressed out. The key to success is just to keep going, to keep believing in yourself. Then no-one can stop you!

Paragon Europe, with the support of
EIT Climate-KIC
, held a very well attended event at the International Press Club Association in Brussels last week. The event introduced a major climate change conference being held under the auspices of the Maltese Presidency of the Council of Europe in May 2017.
Attendees included EU regional offices, private companies and umbrella organisations along with government representatives, academics, scientists, delegates from the Maltese Permanent Delegation and media organisations such as Al-Ahram News, Euractive, EU Observer, Focus Magazine and ANSA.
Paragon Europe are now co-ordinating a Steering Committee which will implement plans agreed with Minister for Sustainable Development, the Environment and Climate Change Dr. José Herrera around the major themes for the conference: mobility and decarbonisation, circular economy, urbanisation and financial instruments to achieve the planned actions.
The event entitled “Climate Change Challenges in the Mediterranean under Malta’s EU Presidency” was opened by Paragon Europe chairman Edwin Ward who stated that if global warming continues on its upward path, and if climate change is not mitigated by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, within the next 30 years Malta could be very different to how we know it today.
Paragon Europe’s Chairman went on to say that global warming will affect Malta in many ways. The impact of climate change will lead to more extreme and haphazard weather patterns, with prolonged Saharan-style heatwaves, more intense rainy periods and longer dry spells. The escalating rise in temperature will be accompanied by severe water shortages as rainfall in Malta is drastically reduced by some 12 per cent, which is significant when the aquifer is already in a critical state.
Other speakers included Bertrand van Ee, Senior Adviser to EIT Climate-KIC, Dr. Mike Cherrett, Director of External Partnerships at EIT Climate-KIC, Paragon Europe CEO Dr. Anton Theuma, Paragon Europe Executive Director Dr. Nadia Theuma and Edward Vernon, Environment Unit Co-Ordinator from Malta’s Permanent Representation to the EU.
Dr. Mike Cherrett, Director of External Partnerships, EIT Climate-KIC gave an overview of Climate-KIC’s global network and showcased a number of successful projects supported by Climate-KIC. In summing up Mr. Ward said that Paragon Europe are proud to lead this initiative from the front as the the national contact point for EIT Climate-KIC.

EIT Awards Winner
2016
Nerdalize
, a Climate-KIC alumni start-up announced their plans for expanding their collaboration with Eneco on Wednesday 7 December in the presence of Prime Minister Mark Rutte.
In 2016, Eneco and Nerdalize have tested the results of the eRadiator in households and the outcomes of the tests are very promising. This drives both parties to make the eRadiator available for a larger number of customers. Mark Rutte was thrilled to toast on this success.
Heat at no cost
Computer servers that perform calculations generate a lot of heat. By installing these servers in people’s homes instead of centralised large data centres, the generated heat can be used to heat these homes at no cost. The purpose of the test was to collect information on customer experience and to identify possible areas of improvement of the eRadiator.
It was the first time the design radiator with built-in server was installed in ordinary households. The servers perform complex calculations for a variety of companies and knowledge institutes, such as new medicine-related research for Leiden University Medical Centre.
Cost reduction of 30 to 55%
A study carried out in cooperation with the Leiden Institute of Advanced Computing Science shows that companies and institutions that require a lot of processing power can reduce their costs in the area of accommodation and cooling of datacentres by 30 to 55% with the concept developed by Nerdalize.
There are major environmental benefits, because the same energy is used for two different purposes: computation and heating.

YEAR: 2016
Dr Richard Tunstall is helping to train the next generation of European entrepreneurs through his work embedding enterprise and innovation into the university curriculum. He took some time out of his busy schedule to chat to us about his experiences with innovation and entrepreneurship.
Tell us, Richard, what does the word ‘innovation’ mean to you?
Innovation is often portrayed as being the realm of new ideas, but for me it’s also about going beyond that to how those new ideas are developed and implemented. It’s important that we see innovation as something that is about not only the development of technology and new products, but about new ways of working, new forms of services and new ways of doing good in society. Innovation is a small word, but it has a lot of big consequences.
As you know, the EIT champions innovation and entrepreneurship with the aim of increasing Europe’s growth and competitiveness at a global level. Why do you think these two particular areas are so essential for Europe’s future?
In terms of Europe’s future, Europe operates in global markets and, increasingly, it’s about how we can bring out new forms of services and goods, and new ways of working. Unless we have an injection of enterprise and innovation, that’s not going to happen.
The reason why growth is important in a global concept is about how we can achieve scale in new innovations and entrepreneurship. Europe is a large place, but in order to really achieve global competitiveness you’re going to have to have a global position. We need entrepreneurship and innovation to instigate that, it’s a challenge that Europe has struggled with and I think the EIT’s initiatives will play a large part in how we’re answering that challenge.
Do you think Europe can rival the Far East and the US in terms of innovation and entrepreneurship?
A lot of our attention is around that growth issue; about how Europe can rival the US in terms of the traction and growth of ventures. But I think that rather than just looking at the US and the Far East in an aspirational way, we need to look at them and say, “How can we do things differently? How can we achieve growth and success through innovative and entrepreneurial means?” It’s about finding the right way for Europe to do it and then trying to capitalise on some of the things we’re already doing and take them further in a way that is unique to Europe, building on these unique competencies and capabilities.
If you had the power, what would you change about entrepreneurship and innovation in Europe?
For me, it’s about abandoning our obsession with the superstar entrepreneur who is going to change everything by themselves and the idea that, as part of that, you must have an interstellar business. That entrepreneurship and innovation are only about one goal and one path to success. Instead we should acknowledge the cultural differences in Europe, develop our strength through diversity and think about how we can actually have more focus on team entrepreneurship, collaboration and open innovation. And focus on entrepreneurship in areas that are challenging – like the environment, sustainability, society and areas of emerging technology – where we can, perhaps, capitalise on opportunities that other people aren’t. It’s about finding niches and developing those, and doing so in a way that will lead to sustainable growth in a way which becomes deeply embedded in Europe’s culture for all, not just the fortunate few.

YEAR: 2017
AI for patient data and antibiotic resistance
Applications will be open between 10 January and 9 March 2018.
Developing artificial intelligence that makes better use of patient data and finding new approaches to overcome antibiotic resistance are the two challenges that EIT Health’s new Wild Card Projects should address in 2018, EIT Health COO Jan-Philipp Beck announced on 5 December.
The announcement came at the EIT Health Summit in London, where a special session was held to explain the Wild Card Projects, a new type of
EIT Health Innovation Project
.
EIT Health Wild Card Projects
are high-risk, innovative projects with transformative potential. The projects are targeted at challenges provided by EIT Health Partners, where the “solution” of the challenge would be a major breakthrough. Each Wild Card Project consists of three distinct steps:
Challenges are set through discussions of the EIT Health partnership.
Shortlisted candidates who want to participate in Wild Card Projects will be invited to a one week tournament, where winning teams will be formed. The tournament is scheduled for 16-20 April 2018 and the deadline for applying to attend is 9 March 2018.
Incubators participating in the programme provide top expertise, facilities and services, to support the winning teams in addressing the challenges.
While the chance that teams will succeed is smaller than in typical Innovation Projects, if they do succeed, the results are expected to have a major impact on healthcare.
Following a process in which EIT Health Partners were solicited for their input, the two challenges for 2018 were chosen. In more detail the challenges are as follows:
Smart Health
: Personalised patient data can revolutionise diagnosis and treatment – but the real problem is capturing, storing and making sense of it. The Smart Health challenge sets entrepreneurs the task of building new solutions that use Artificial Intelligence to quickly interpret large, unstructured data sets within existing regulatory frame works, allowing healthcare professionals across the EU to improve patient care.
Fight Back
: Left unchecked, antibiotic resistance could become Europe’s biggest health crisis. Simple hospital procedures will carry risk again, while old, dangerous diseases could become widespread. The Fight Back challenge tasks entrepreneurs with building innovative solutions to take on antibiotic resistance. The most effective solution must raise awareness of the problem, while also enabling new processes and methodologies to manage it across the EU healthcare landscape.
Applications from those who want to take up these challenges open 10 January 2018, so now is a good time to find out more.

YEAR: 2017
A new EIT Climate-KIC supported capacity-building tool for climate-smart agriculture (CSA) was launched this week at the headquarters of the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) in Rome.
The tool, called
Agrisource
, is Europe’s first open innovation platform (OIP) for climate-smart agriculture, developed by CIRAD and INRA, France’s top agricultural research institutions and funded by
EIT Climate-KIC
’s flagship programme CSA Booster, supported by EIT, a body of the European Union.
Image
Agrisource will bring together international actors including businesses, research institutions, farmers, cooperatives, investors, NGOs, policy-makers and start-ups in a virtual environment to map, connect and stimulate debate on innovative CSA technologies and solutions, acting as a catalyst and hub for new regional and international projects. It will be a key resource for those seeking information or innovation, and a network hub for people with new ideas for climate change mitigation and adaptation from agrifood value chains.
This new capacity-building tool connects and maps inter-related research and innovation programmes and combines a powerful search engine and expert community content to foster public-private partnerships in climate-smart agriculture. The new platform offers a systemic approach to sustain CSA and drive cross-sectoral transformation across international agriculture and food value chains.
Welcoming the launch, Pan Pan, Head of EIT Climate-KIC’s Flagship Programme
CSA Booster
and Deputy Director of the Sustainable Land Use theme said:
'
To accelerate CSA and achieve agrifood system change, we must engage, map and connect many diverse actors across international agricultural value chains.
[tweetable alt="Agrisource is the first CSA open innovation platform in Europe and a vital tool to facilitate the sharing of expert knowledge, cross-regiona"]Agrisource is the first CSA open innovation platform in Europe and a vital tool to facilitate the sharing of expert knowledge, cross-regional collaboration, co-creation of solutions and public-private matchmaking.[/tweetable]'
Agrisource’s lead developer Marc Nougier of INRA said:
'
Agrisource is a new capacity-building tool at the crossroads of knowledge and networks in CSA. It offers a new, systemic approach to climate change, combining a powerful search engine with community-created content, to drive innovation, communication, partnerships and knowledge-sharing
.'
Co-developer and Agrisource technical lead Jean-Baptiste Laurent of CIRAD said:
'
[tweetable]We designed this platform to serve the needs of entire agrifood value chains[/tweetable], from labs and research communities to retail brands and farmers and the field players of agriculture who together are the creators and guardians of climate-smart agriculture
.'
CSA Booster is Europe’s leading knowledge and innovation hub pioneering the transition to climate-smart agriculture and food across Europe, and around the world. As the EU regional alliance for the FAO’s Global Alliance for Climate-Smart Agriculture (GACSA), it will actively promote engagement across its ecosystem of expert research communities and innovation networks to drive engagement and uptake of the new Agrisource platform.
CSA Booster’s initial content on the new platform focuses on fruit, dairy and wine value chains but Agrisource will expand to include new value chains as more communities generate content. Agrisource resources are currently available in English and French, with additional languages and functionalities already under development.

YEAR: 2017
Revolutionary online healthcare platform PhysioWizard raised GBP 1 million from business angels Archangels.
The Scottish early stage company PhysioMedics - one of the
EIT Health
UK-Ireland finalists of the Headstart/Proof-of-Concept grants in 2016 - has developed a revolutionary online self-assessment platform for muscle and joint pain sufferers. They recently raised GBP 1 million from Edinburgh-based business angel syndicate, Archangels, with support from leading medtech and digital health incubator, BioCity Group Ltd, and Scottish Investment Bank, the investment arm of Scottish Enterprise.
Image
The software, called
PhysioWizard
, has been developed to match patients suffering muscle and joint problems with the most appropriate healthcare professional (triage). Patients can access the PhysioWizard self-assessment tool online and complete the process in 15 minutes. The tool has been clinically trialed to deliver assessments for all lower body regions and the company is on track to launch the full body triage tool in 2018.
Currently, insurance and occupational health companies employ healthcare professionals to triage patients over the telephone, which is an expensive and time-consuming use of resource. PhysioWizard provides a consistent and convenient alternative, produces automated clinical reports and refers patients quickly and cost effectively to the recommended professional.
The system has been developed by the PhysioMedics team of specialist clinicians. By distilling their clinical experience derived from treating thousands of patients with muscle and joint problems, the software has been carefully scoped using everyday language to ensure patients understand and engage with the online assessment.
A year ago, PhysioWizard raised GBP 250 000 of seed funding and has now received a further GBP 750 000, in a funding round led by Archangels, to accelerate the commercial launch of its existing product, to develop and finesse the software tool and to develop sales channels internationally.
The company is already working with large health insurance providers to implement the system in early 2018.
'
PhysioMedics has come a long way in 12 months and this funding will enable us not only to develop our commercial platform but also explore opportunities in the US and Australia',
said PhysioMedics' Managing Director, Kirsten Lord. '[tweetable]I am confident that PhysioWizard can make a real difference[/tweetable], and a meaningful contribution, to helping sufferers of muscle and joint pain live healthier lives.'
'
[tweetable alt="The PhysioMedics team has demonstrated that they have a viable product and one that is attractive to health insurance and occupational healt"]The PhysioMedics team has demonstrated that they have a viable product and one that is attractive to health insurance and occupational health providers[/tweetable]
' said Dr Sarah Hardy, Chief Investment Officer at Archangels. '
At Archangels we are proud of our track record of follow-on funding and we look forward to the next chapter in the PhysioMedics story
.'
'
Scottish Enterprise, through the Scottish Investment Bank, is delighted to be co-investing with Archangels to allow the company to develop and commercialise PhysioWizard
.' said Kerry Sharp, Head of Scottish Investment Bank. '
We look forward to working alongside PhysioMedics to help it achieve its potential, both in Scotland and internationally

YEAR: 2017
"Capiche" is a translation and search service that combines artificial intelligence (AI) with crowd knowledge.
Modern language assistants and chat bots are only as smart as their database running in the background. They understand the common Western European languages and respond to things they have already learned. But what happens if someone asks his question in Arabic or Pashto or Tigrinya? Today's website and service providers are confronted with a multitude of requests in different languages that are not handled by the usual language assistants. This often leaves questions from refugees unanswered.
Image
Capiche is a translation and tracing service based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) and crowd knowledge that aims to improve communication with and from refugees in Europe. The application was developed in cooperation with the German refugee information portal
www.HandbookGermany.de
and presented in Berlin during the
EIT Digital Germany Innovation Day.
It is the first AI system on the market that integrates crowdsourcing and uses the resulting data for teaching the AI system. Capiche is a spin-off of EIT Digital's European Refugee Information and Communication Service (ERICS) Innovation Activity and was developed in cooperation with
EIT Digital
partners TU Berlin, T-Systems Multimedia Solutions GmbH, DFKI, Aalto University and Crowdee GmbH.
As the number of refugees increases, so does the number of people in Europe that have to overcome major obstacles in everyday life due to a lack of language skills, e.g. in understanding websites and information brochures or in communicating with authorities. Direct demand from senders is rarely possible, as national operators of websites, online journals, and public administration institutions usually do not use direct communication, if they do not understand Arabic, for example. A lack of language skills leads to a loss of information, unanswered questions and slower integration.
Capiche is a new solution for these information providers: it now enables small editorial offices to offer their users content in non-standard languages. Via an interface in the Content Management System, content is played via a cloud-based micro-service to the AI system and the crowd, with the help of which it is translated and returned in the desired language. In this way, Capiche helps to overcome language barriers and promote integration. In the next phase, Capiche will be available as multilingual real-time communication in all major EU and refugee languages, including an extremist and fake news filter. In the future, it will also be possible for a user to put his or her question directly to an information portal in his or her own language, and the combination of artificial intelligence and human crowd intelligence to find the answer quickly and easily in his or her own language.
Among many other things, Capiche's decisive advantages and opportunities for deployment from which refugees might benefit are:
Real-time translation service: German, English, Arabic, Persian and more languages from 2018 onwards;
Fake news check and extremist filter;
Legal review of documents on the crowd;
Requests for location information and public facilities can be sent to the chatbot system in the foreign language.
Stéphane Péan,
Digital Cities Action
Line Leader, confirms this: '
Thanks to AI algorithms and collaborative crowdsourcing, Capiche can help refugees with reliable translations, improving their integration and hospitality in our European cities. Even outside this specific area of application, this technology-based translation and information service has great potential for both public sector operators and businesses.
'
Capiche can reduce integration costs and shorten the time to start working by reliably translating services offered by public and private organisations in the fields of transport, health care, education or legal advice and information on job offers or consumer goods for daily needs. In this way, Capiche helps to meet the needs of refugees with regard to companies or institutions - and vice versa.
Ronald Schulz, Head of Data & Content Driven Services at T-Systems MMS explains: '
[tweetable alt="With Capiche, we are filling the gaps in artificial intelligence with the help of human swarm intelligence."]With Capiche, we are filling the gaps in artificial intelligence with the help of human swarm intelligence. [/tweetable]This will revolutionize the way we deal with multilingual content. It will be much easier than it is today to deliver content to people who speak another language.
'
EIT Digital's innovation activities deliver new products or services and create startups and spin-offs to commercialize project results. They also support the transfer of technologies for market entry. Capiche (ERICS) is one of 11 innovation activities of the Digital Cities Action Line 2017, which brings digital transformation to cities. It promotes centralised, participatory and collaborative cooperation between the individual actors in a city: government, municipal service providers, industry and citizens.

YEAR: 2017
ThingWave, a start-up supported by
EIT RawMaterials
, provides solutions for real-time and online rock bolt monitoring.
The
ThingWave
smart rock bolt, developed by researchers Jens Eliasson and Pablo Punal Pereira at the Luleå University of Technology, is expected to contribute to an increase in mine safety. Mining companies around the world are now showing great interest in the product.
Image
'
The market potential is huge. Only LKAB, which has about one percent of the market, puts 400,000 bolts in the mine every year. [tweetable alt="Mining companies in Australia, New Zealand and Sweden are very interested in testing our system and we can see a lot of interest in both lar"]Mining companies in Australia, New Zealand and Sweden are very interested in testing our system and we can see a lot of interest in both large and small companies[/tweetable]
', said Jens Eliasson, Assistant Professor of Industrial Electronics and CEO of ThingWave.
Mining bolts are long bars of iron that are mounted into mines to stabilize the rock. ThingWave’s monitoring system consists of a gateway with a small computer that keeps track of sensors mounted on the mining bolt. The sensors detect whether the bolt is tilted, breaks or vibrates and sends an alarm. What happens in the rock bolt can be observed by the mining worker on a mobile phone or by e-mail and by the bolt blinking with red, green or yellow lights. Gateway also creates its own wireless network that it communicates with.
An important advantage of ThingWave is that it manages to find networks in challenging environments and “around corners”, such as in tunnels and mines. Parts of the networks can then take over if any part breaks and fails to communicate.
ThingWave has been tested short-term in mines in Sweden. Now tests are extended to Finland and Chile.
The smart rock bolt has won three prestigious pit competitions for new innovative products. A large part of the funding for developing the product comes in the form of booster funding from the EU’s major effort to develop the mining sector,
EIT RawMaterials
, where the Luleå University of Technology is a coordinator.

YEAR: 2017
EIT Digital has named Lexplore as the best European technology scale-up 2017 in the field of Digital Wellbeing
Lexplore
, the developer of an artificial intelligence and machine learning method for identifying children with dyslexia, has won first prize in the Digital Wellbeing category of the annual
EIT Digital Challenge
.
The prize includes a EUR 50 000 cash prize and full year of growth support from the
EIT Digital
Accelerator worth an additional EUR 50 000.

Dyslexia is a difficult word for a pretty common problem that can make life tough: reading and writing disabilities. It is estimated that between 10 and 20 per cent of the population suffers from dyslexia, which may vary by country
, explained Dominik Krabbe, EIT Digital Challenge Lead. He continued: '
The EIT Digital Challenge aims to detect Europe's best digital technology scale-ups that promise to improve the life of Europe's citizens and strengthen the economy. [tweetable alt="Lexplore is exactly what we are looking for: they are addressing a large and important need."]Lexplore is exactly what we are looking for: they are addressing a large and important need. [/tweetable]With the EIT Digital Accelerator, we will now support Lexplore to expand internationally and make their method available to more people in Europe and beyond
.'
'
[tweetable]When I read about the EIT Digital Challenge, I thought it was a great opportunity and match for us[/tweetable]. Winning would give us a lot credibility and trust. And we did indeed obtain the best possible endorsement for our solution as EIT Digital believed in us and chose us as the winner,
' said Lexplore CEO Fredrik Wetterhall.
Lexplore's process is completely digital and consists of three stages: test, analysis and results.
The test is individual, working with one student at a time. Lexplore conducts the tests on school premises, taking only a few minutes per student. The child reads two short passages on a computer screen while his or her eye movements are recorded using an eye-tracking device. When the test is completed, the student can go back to class.
'
Our point of departure is the direct relationship between eye movement patterns and cognition that is well-established in current research. It is important to note that irregular eye movement patterns don't cause dyslexia - they are neurological markers of the problems encountered by those with dyslexia when reading. Moreover, the eye movements are not the key to any intervention solutions,
' said Fredrik Wetterhall, as he explained the analysis process step.
Image
When the analysis is completed, the results are made accessible on a web portal where authorized users can log on. The results reveal clearly which students are either at risk or not for the condition. This avoids unnecessary assessments, so that time and resources can be used where they are needed most. The information on the web portal is secure and encrypted, and all data is handled in accordance with the applicable information privacy regulations.
'
Thanks to us participating in the EIT Digital Challenge, we have a lot of new contacts and it was rewarding to learn about the other great companies participating in the challenge. And this is only the starting point: the big value will be next year when we will be part of the EIT Digital Accelerator. As a result, we will gain a lot more visibility and contacts within EIT Digital and its partners,
' said Fredrik Wetterhall.
The EIT Digital Accelerator comprises a team of experienced business developers and fundraising experts. They operate from 13 cities across Europe as well as a hub in San Francisco. Since 2012, they have supported more than 260 startups in accessing new markets and have helped them raise more than
EUR 90 million
in investment to date.
In total, five digital technology companies from across Europe competed in front of an international expert jury during the EIT Digital Innovation Day in Trento, Italy. This Digital Wellbeing final was part of a series of five EIT Digital Challenge final events, each dedicated to a specific digital technology topic. The full list is below:

The innovation project will improve communication between elderly patients and healthcare professionals
EIT Digital
and its European partners launched a new care innovation to help elderly people prepare for visits to their doctor. Medical consultations have a small time limit, and elderly people in particular can find it difficult to ask the right questions about their conditions, which can make it difficult to get the best treatment.
The EIT Digital innovation called the Virtual Training Doctor
lets patients practice conversations beforehand in order to be better prepared for visits to the doctor.
The first version of this care innovation was unveiled at
EIT Digital's BeNeLux Innovation Day
, on 4 December in Eindhoven.
In this 'serious game'
the user practices with a virtual medical expert and learns how to ask the right questions and make their goals and wishes clear
. This improves one to one communication between the health care practitioner and patient, enabling them to decide together on the best treatment.
'Good communication and shared decision making are vital for wellbeing and health. It increases therapy adherence and reduces re-hospitalisation'
, says Johan Jeuring, activity lead and professor of Software Technology for Learning and Education at the University of Utrecht.
The Virtual Training Doctor is one of EIT Digital’s Digital Wellbeing action line innovation activites. It has been developed by the
University of Utrecht
together with
DialogueTrainer
,
Vilans
, the
University of Edinburgh
and the
Politehnica University of Bucharest
. This international collaboration has huge advantages, said Jeuring.
'Thanks to the collaboration with European partners who work on natural language processing, we were able to add advanced language technology to the product. Also, we were given the chance to trial it with elderly patients in Scotland for example.'

The project aims to accelerate innovation clusters to create thriving and prosperous low carbon cities
ConnectedClusters
is a collaboration between
EIT Climate-KIC
partners in Edinburgh, London, Birmingham, Frankfurt and Valencia. Between now and 2020, the cities will share, replicate and scale what works in developing innovation ecosystems for delivering effective climate action.
Helen Dunk
,
ConnectedClusters project lead
for the
Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Innovation (ECCI)
—EIT Climate-KIC’s partner in Scotland—said:
Image
'We’re all familiar with the way in which clusters of complementary start-ups and skilled workers can drive commercial growth—Silicon Valley is a classic example. EIT Climate-KIC believes the emergence of broader city region-based innovation clusters focused specifically on climate could be key to meeting our emissions targets and delivering local economic benefits. Our aim is to explore how best to accelerate these wider ecosystems—that bring together businesses, academics, communities and governments to deliver on low carbon solutions—in our own city regions and others across Europe.'
ConnectedClusters will develop new collaborative approaches to technology, procurement, investment and training and, through a comprehensive training programme, it will help region clusters become more effective in accessing capital and working collaboratively across sectors.
It will also support interaction between supply and demand-side organisations through networking and industry matchmaking events. Besides, a series of studies will shed light on key structural challenges to delivering low carbon solutions.

The project aims to engage a wide range of city and regional actors with shared goals and forthcoming opportunities.
Jon Bloomfield
, Systems Innovation Manager for EIT Climate-KIC’s Urban Transitions work, said:
'Cities are facing huge challenges—social, economic and democratic. But the threat of climate breakdown will affect and compound all of these. Cities and regions can’t tackle these challenges alone. They need to bring people together across sectors and industries—from start-ups to big business, researchers, municipal authorities and communities themselves.
How can the emergence of these clusters best be developed and—crucially—accelerated? What can be shared for others to build on? That’s what we’re exploring in ConnectedClusters.

EIT InnoEnergy held a session at the COP24 UN Climate Change Conference
A session entitled “Electrification of mobility” was organised by
EIT InnoEnergy
and
Eurelectric
at the
UN COP24
, on 4 December in Katowice (Poland). A cost-effective full decarbonisation of our economy by mid-century is not an option anymore. With the European power sector committing to be fully carbon-neutral well before 2050, new opportunities are opening to Europe. Hosted by
Céline Jullien
, Industry Programme Management Officer at EIT InnoEnergy,
the panel highlighted the challenges and opportunities created by the electrification of mobility.
It put the light on key public and private initiatives, such as the
European Battery Alliance
or the gigafactories that can help decarbonise the energy supply and demand cost-effectively.
Image
Speakers of the panel included
Henning Häder
, Manager Energy Policy, Climate & Sustainability at
Eurelectric
,
Peter Carlsson
, CEO of
Northvolt
,
Krzysztof Bolesta
, Vice-­President,
Electric Vehicles Promotion Foundation
,
Peter Badik
, Co-­founder & managing partner,
Greenway
as well as
Guillaume Gillet
, Manager of UE Business Unit of EIT lnnoEnergy.
Peter Carlsson
said:
'The snowball effect of EV we are seeing now will become bigger when consumers will realise it is a better investment than buying old fuel vehicles. To run the electromobility transition we will need 40 large scale factories'.
Northvolt was founded with the mission to build the world’s greenest battery, with a minimal carbon footprint and the highest ambitions for recycling, to enable the European transition to renewable energy.
EIT InnoEnergy has already invested EUR 3.5 million to support the creation of Europe’s first large scale battery factory.
Image
In this landscape, electrification of our energy usages, notably of mobility, will have a growing role to play. At the crossroad of penetration of renewables, storage, and decentralised energy,
electrified mobility progressively appears as a one-off opportunity to be seized by Europe for global competitiveness
while supporting European automotive and electricity industries.
Guillaume Gillet
commented:
'The European Battery Alliance is a pragmatic alliance, which thanks to its bottom-up approach, brings the project closer to the industrials and the consumers'.
For this future to happen, battery is a key technology, building bridge between mobility and power systems. For instance, flexibility services that Vehicle to Grid technologies provide for balancing of the electricity grid could become an important element of the integrated energy system.

Meet the EIT InnoEnergy supported start-up, Ecobean, which is producing clean energy from coffee waste.
Globally, people drink more than 2 billion cups of coffee per day and this generates a huge amount of coffee waste. Over 500 million cups of coffee are drunk annually in Poland alone. EcoBean, together with Warsaw University of Technology, has developed technology for the production of coffee briquettes from spent coffee grounds. The start-up has recently joined the
EIT InnoEnergy
ecosystem receiving comprehensive support with financial investment.
Recycling coffee waste
Recycling coffee waste helps reduce greenhouse gases and gives cappuccino a useful second life. EcoBean’s Coffee Briquette is made from the grounds of 30 cups of coffee. The aim is to collect and process thousands of tons of spent coffee grounds turning waste into clean energy. The idea is to collect raw material from coffee chains, restaurants and petrol stations. Giving coffee a second life will reduce the CO
2
footprint and save trees used to produce traditional briquets.
In Poland alone, people spend PLN 2.3 billion on coffee, generating 120 k tons of coffee waste. Those numbers are growing steadily by 5-7% each year. We are working with market leaders and finalising agreement.
Marcin Koziorowski, CEO of EcoBean
Carbon neutral biofuel
Coffee logs are a carbon neutral biofuel produced from waste coffee grounds. They are perfect for open fires, BBQs, stoves and fireplaces burning longer and producing more energy than wood. Coffee logs are cost effective in production, providing a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil fuels. The company's plan is to build the first zero-emission factory in Europe with a capacity to recycle 20 000 tons of spent coffee grounds which means for Poland savings such as 10 000 tons of CO
2
and at least 1 ha of forest annually.

EIT RawMaterials supported RoStar project developed a prototype of an ultra-fine grinding mill.
It liberates more ores and consumes less energy.
Less energy consumption
The mill is a prototype of a new ultra-fine grinding mill for the liberation of high-value particles met in platinum-group metals containing ores, copper ores or other polymetallic ores with fine dissemination of mineral phases.
This mill consumes 20-30% less energy compared to similar established mills and increases ore liberation with at least 20% less locked ore at same particle size.
Professor Urs Peuker at Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg and leader of the RoStar project
The RoStar prototype has proven to increase the operation period with 50% before maintenance is needed. Additionally, the maintenance itself is 50% faster compared to similarly established mills, due to an optimised rotor-stator geometry and improved wear resistance through a modular construction of the mill housing.
The RoStar mill offers an answer to the forthcoming challenges already seen in fine milling trends. Tangible applications are opened in re-grinding-flotation circuits, tailings re-processing as well as in enabling access to future deposits containing valuable or critical materials.
Professor Peuker
The mill will be a vertical fine grinding mill, where gravity forces enable a higher filling level than in horizontal mills and a hydraulic pressure on the grinding beads. The new improved design of the Mills Rotor/Stator system was launched into the market in the year 2018.
Deliverables of the RoStar innovation project will be a containerised pilot plant, a fine milling process with very low energy consumption. A flexible and mobile unit is set up and followed by a demonstration and proving of mill performance in a real industrial environment, the testing takes place at Assarel-Medet (SME) plant site in Bulgaria.

Integrated healthcare can improve care and reduce costs. Read the interview with the EIT Health Supervisory Board Member Ursula Redeker.
Ursula Redeker
is Spokeswoman for the Management of Roche Diagnostics GmbH. She is also a member of the EIT Health Supervisory Board, a member of the Board of Trustees of the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) in Heidelberg, Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Rhine-Neckar Metropolitan Region and shareholder representative on the Supervisory Board of ABB AG.
How can we improve healthcare and reduce its cost at the same time? It sounds as ambitious as 'squaring the circle', but if we look closely, we can see that it is in fact possible to provide better health at lower cost.
EIT Community has a fairly segmented approach to the provision of healthcare today. As patients, EIT Community sees doctors, nurses, social workers, physiotherapists and many other healthcare professionals helping us to maintain or regain good health. They must plan together, treat patients together, and talk to one another, a dynamic that often needs to be continued in the long term, particularly for chronic diseases. This becomes a challenge when processes, regulation and mindset are not all focused on integration of care. The growth in medical knowledge necessitates increased specialisation, which is valuable but results in fragmentation that requires a challenging level of governing infrastructure and reimbursement principles.
Integrating healthcare to provide seamless end-to-end care will reduce costs by optimising interfaces, reducing redundancies and avoiding communication breaks and information gaps. It will improve outcomes by making information easily available and providing constant feedback loops for all involved in care. It will enable truly personalised care. And it will help to shift the focus from treating disease to maintaining health, thereby promising both better healthcare and reduced costs.
Ursula Redeker, EIT Health Supervisory Board Member
Some of the main challenges that I believe EIT Community must address in order to develop, nurture and scale integrated care models across Europe include:
Data: Enabling and facilitating data sharing across all stakeholders in healthcare is essential to ensure best outcomes for patients and increase operational efficiency. Beyond this, new technologies, such as smart wearables, offer additional opportunities to capture relevant data, very often strongly owned and driven by the patient.
Reimbursement: We currently pay for health services based on the individual test, treatment or medicine provided to the patient. This doesn't necessarily focus on the impact achieved for individual patients or patient groups. In order for true reform to work, we need to think about moving towards a reimbursement model that focuses on outcomes – and puts the same emphasis on maintaining health as we put on regaining health.
Policy: We see many healthcare professionals and healthcare provider groups optimising their processes and measures to improve outcomes for patients. Doing this requires optimisation along the whole care process from a patient or population perspective.
Tackling all of these challenges is, of course, no small task. While
EIT Community may still be some years away from total reform
, EIT Community is seeing pilots testing integrated healthcare on a regional level or focused on a disease.
Innovative integrated care system
One example is the 'Gesundes Kinzigtal' model (GK) in Germany, where healthcare within a local community has been organised as an innovative integrated care system. The
GK model focuses on three key principles
: better population health, improved experience of care, and reduced per-capita costs. The results of the GK model clearly demonstrated that patient satisfaction and population health can be improved while decreasing the overuse of health services and medicines.
In the EIT Health portfolio, the innovation project iPDM-GO is improving diabetes care by providing a personalised diabetes management platform.
Ursula Redeker, EIT Health Supervisory Board Member
In the EIT Health portfolio, the innovation project
iPDM-GO
is improving diabetes care by providing a personalised diabetes management platform that integrates diagnostic results with relevant medication and personal information – to help patients and their doctors achieve better short- and long-term outcomes. Controlling blood glucose levels is a highly complex process and a major task for patients. Although monitoring and treatment are readily available, staying within the required blood-sugar range remains a challenge. Providing individual feedback loops and continuous information for patients and doctors can help avoid long-term complications and associated pain and cost.
Addressing epilepsy by innovating seizure detection
Another EIT Health project, called
SeizeIT
, is addressing epilepsy by innovating seizure detection. Currently, seizures are being reported with a patient diary, or are measured during hospital stays. This provides a lot of room for seizures to be underreported, but accuracy is relevant to establishing optimal care. By providing a discreet device that patients can wear at home, SeizeIT is working towards a reality where all seizures can be detected. This will improve patient lives and help medical professionals understand more about the condition, and improve treatments available.
The variety of healthcare systems across Europe share some common challenges. Integrated healthcare is one of those. EIT Health offers an opportunity to explore pilots and innovative approaches to achieve this vision. Let’s use these opportunities to create improvements that provide the best value for citizens and patients.

EIT InnoEnergy
invests in Northvolt to commercialise new lithium-ion recovery methods to support 2030 recycling targets.
EIT InnoEnergy
has announced its EUR 5.8 million investment into
Northvolt
’s 'Revolt' programme. The programme, which will implement the latest discoveries in efficient materials recovery methods, will see the construction of a pilot battery recycling plant, followed by a full-scale version at Northvolt’s site in Skellefteå in 2022. The EIT InnoEnergy investment supports Northvolt’s target of using 50% recycled materials in all its new battery cells by 2030.
Boosting circular economy initiatives
The announcement comes just two days after the European Green Deal highlighted the importance of circular economy initiatives to 'mainstream' sustainability throughout European policy.
This is a landmark investment and one that has a mission critical role to play in addressing climate issues. Europe’s energy transition relies on creating a local, competitive and sustainable battery value supply chain that can support the electrification of the transport, power and industrial sectors. As battery volumes are expected to increase drastically, it will be doubly important that, as an industry, we do everything we can to reduce their manufacturing footprint.
Diego Pavia, CEO at EIT InnoEnergy
'As such, greener battery technologies are a cornerstone of a sustainable future, and we are actively seeking to invest in technologies that can unlock economic and environmental benefits. Better technologies mean we can manufacture much more with less, using recycled raw materials and less energy', added Diego.
The aim of using 50% recycled materials by 2030 will be achieved through a gradual build-up in capacity. The pilot plant will process 100 tons a year, while the full-scale unit initially will look to recycle 25 000 tons of battery cells a year. At present, much of Europe’s recyclable battery materials are thought to be exported abroad for reuse in countries such as China and Korea.
Long-term support and collaboration
We are very pleased to have the continued support of EIT InnoEnergy as we take this next step in developing our blueprint for sustainable battery manufacturing. Our partnership with EIT InnoEnergy has been vital in getting us to where we are today; not only has it provided investments, it has opened doors for us across Europe.
Peter Carlsson, CEO Northvolt
Northvolt’s programme builds on two years of research where, in conjunction with researchers at Chalmers University, Sweden, it has optimised the process design for hydrometallurgical treatment. The process allows for more efficient recovery of valuable metals including lithium, nickel, manganese and cobalt.
This latest investment brings EIT InnoEnergy’s total capital contributions to Northvolt to EUR 9.3 million, following an earlier investment of EUR 3.5 million three years ago. Both investments help EIT InnoEnergy unlock the estimated EUR 250 billion annual European battery market, identified by the European Battery Alliance.
Northvolt is just one of several battery supply chain start-ups EIT InnoEnergy supports, and it has resources to support more. Earlier this autumn, EIT InnoEnergy issued its first ever global
call for start-ups
across the entire sustainability value chain. Following strong growth within the storage market, EIT InnoEnergy expects this call to attract a significant number of new storage innovations.

In a pilot project coordinated by the
EIT Digital
Partner
Forum Virium Helsinki
, the
LMAD
robot receives gifts for a holiday charity campaign in Finland.
Christmas Tree, in Finnish ‘
Joulupuu
’, is a charity campaign to collect gifts for children who receive child welfare services or special support and who have limited opportunities to celebrate the holidays. Anyone can participate in the gift collection.
The
LMAD
robot Elf, where LMAD stands for Last Mile Autonomous Delivery, will deliver the gifts for the charity campaign to Helsinki social services, who will, in turn, deliver the gifts to the families. The robot allows the gifts to be collected safely outdoors, in keeping with the pandemic instructions.
At the same time, the robot is also collecting data on the challenges and opportunities of autonomous deliveries. Testing the delivery robot in a real urban environment provides valuable information on the problems and opportunities of autonomous deliveries. Especially interesting is to see how autonomously moving logistics robots can solve last-mile delivery challenges.
The robot pilot is part of
EIT Digital
’s Last Mile Autonomous Delivery innovation activity. It aims to develop and bring to market a software platform for controlling and optimising autonomously moving delivery robots. The practical operations are handled by the
LMAD
start-up.
This test period where the robot delivers real packages from to real customers already proves that delivery robots are a flexible and environmentally-friendly alternative for package deliveries in densely built urban environments, such as Helsinki city centre.

Big data and machine learning for prediction of corrosion.
Corrosion is a disease to materials and poses a significant risk to many industrial facilities and structures such as pipelines, storage tanks, boilers, heat exchangers, and other equipment and systems. Overall, corrosion is one of the critical materials failure mechanism in industry and annually responsible for costs amounting to trillions of euros. In the
EIT RawMaterials
up-scaling project '
CorTools
', corrosion on-line monitoring and prediction software tools are developed to respond to the needs of raw materials industry.
We need to understand the behaviour of construction materials of tanks, containers, pipes, mixers, i.e. stainless steels in the operation conditions. In this project, we focus on raw materials processing conditions and are creating a materials selection tool, a virtual expert and corrosion on-line monitoring solution.
Elina Huttunen-Saarivirta, Research Professors, VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd
The unique Cortools consortium: Boliden Harjavalta Oy, DMS, Ferritico, Outokumpu Stainless AB, Metso:Outotec, Tecnalia, ZAG and VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd, enables the co-creation and industrial validation of the tools. For the industrial project partners, the developed tools enable more than 1 M€ annual savings through the prevention of corrosion failures. For the European raw materials industry in whole, the project may allow billions of euros in savings.
The software tool will make it easier to support our technical marketing and sales. The tool will decrease the need for time-consuming corrosion testing and it will be easier for the industry to choose the most optimum stainless steel grade as construction material.
Lena Wegrelius, Head of Corrosion, Outokumpu Stainless AB
Collaboration across the whole industrial value chain is carried out in the project to cover multiple dimensions (laboratory, pilot, operational environment) in the tool prediction capabilities and thus facilitate market penetration of the software tool. The use of digital on-site measuring technologies and computer modelling will connect various operational scales, therefore contributing to an improvement in material- and energy efficiency of the raw materials processing industries.
Machine learning creates ”virtual expert”
The corrosion on-line monitoring and prediction software tools provide the raw materials sector yet another footstep towards digitalisation. Another giant progress is the link to artificial intelligence (AI). In this project, AI is used in computational modelling. Furthermore, a remote collection of on-line monitoring data allows later for the hidden causalities in the project conditions (e.g. mineral quality in hydrometallurgy) and the detected corrosion rate to be disclosed with the aid of AI. The software tool is developed by the project partner Ferritico.
We make use of the available data when creating this virtual expert. Industries have huge sets of experimentally measured corrosion data and this is a big source of information and motivation to develop a machine learning tool. We are predicting failure events based on all of the available features instead of developing complex physical or chemical models of corrosion.
Satish Kolli, Materials Informatics Engineer, Ferritico
The user needs are twofold. First, a materials selection tool, a “virtual expert”, that allows for evaluation of a corrosion risk of materials under various operation conditions emerged. Based on machine learning, this “virtual expert” finds the safe operating conditions for a given material and estimates the lifetime of materials in specific conditions. Second, on-line corrosion monitoring systems in industrial facilities reveal the actual corrosion rate of the materials and makes it possible to evaluate the remaining lifetime of the components.

Launched within the
EIT Digital
Innovation Factory
, the start-up
Entremo
is deploying their product, a wristband to remotely monitor the vital signs of patients, in hospitals and nursing homes in Hungary.
In less than six months, a team of five
EIT Digital Master School
students went from successfully winning a high-profile European hackathon to incorporating their start-up,
Entremo
, where more than 20 people are currently contributing. Entremo is about to deploy their main product, a wristband to remotely monitor the vital signs of patients, in hospitals and nursing homes in Hungary.
Entremo’s journey within EIT Digital is testimony to how teamwork, talent and entrepreneurial spirit can quickly generate results. It all started with a group of friends passionate about using technology to improve people’s health and wellbeing, all of them involved in different EIT Digital Master School programmes: Data Science graduate Peter Lakatos, the CEO of Entremo, teamed up with Márton Elodi (Human Computer Interaction and Design), Miklós Knebel (Autonomous Systems), Levente Mitnyik (Embedded Systems) and Peter Danos (Visual computing and communication).
Together with another friend, motion graphic designer Kristóf Nagy, they formed Team Discover, a group of developers which successfully took part in several hackathons in the last two years. They received a special
EIT Health
award at the Hack the Crisis Hungary hackathon in early 2020. In April they went on to
win
the European Commission #EUvsVirus hackathon’s Healthcare category with a prototype of their 3D-printed remote monitoring device.
The device originally came in the shape of ‘smart glasses’, worn by patients to check parameters such as body temperature, oxygen saturation, pulse and respiratory rates. The measured data is then made available to the medical staff via an online platform. As a result, instead of one patient, nurses are able to check on dozens of them at the same time.
Then things started moving fast. In mid-2020, EIT Digital Innovation Factory launched the "DATA against COVID-19" initiative, with the objective of quickly developing digital tools to fight back the pandemic. The EUvsVirus award had given the team significant international exposure and put them on the radar of companies and institutions, so they quickly found four partners:
ELTE-Soft
,
MOHAnet
and
Eötvös Lorand University
from Hungary and
InnoTractor
from the Netherlands.
The activity was
selected
by the Innovation Factory and received EUR 500 000 of support from EIT Digital. Later, the Entremo team decided to pivot their product, dropping the ‘smart glasses’ shape for a more convenient and practical wristband, with similar features but better usability.
The glasses were more invasive, and they also might be in the way of oxygen masks for COVID patients. In addition, people are used to having watches on their hands 24/7, so that doctors can get analysis from night activities as well.
Peter Lakatos, the CEO of Entremo
All the other missing pieces ended up falling into place.
We've been developing our product with the four partner companies for the past six months and it's been quite a hectic journey; there were so many new experiences that we went through. But I’m happy to say that now we have all the pipeline ready: from the measuring device to its communication with the data collection hubs, and then the communication of the data collection hubs with our servers, up to pushing the data from the servers to the display of the medical staff .
Peter Lakatos, the CEO of Entremo.
Right now, the team is 3D printing the first batches of 50 devices which will be used in the first two product deployments in Hungary, scheduled in December, with two other Hungarian pilots planned for January. Entremo is currently looking for investors to further scale the company.

Over 120
EIT Alumni
came together on 28 and 29 November to connect, build partnerships, co-create projects, and work together to develop the EIT Alumni Community.
EIT Alumni CONNECT  is the annual big event and opportunity for EIT Alumni members to meet, discuss and debate on social, environmental and technological challenges.
The theme of the 2020 EIT Alumni CONNECT was
'Responsible Consumption and Production'
and how EIT Alumni could address it. It was about how to do more and better with less, about decoupling economic growth from environmental degradation, increasing resource efficiency, and promoting sustainable lifestyles.
Alongside interactive networking session, a series of workshops allowed our members to get unique insights from external organisations, and from members of the EIT Alumni Communities:
EIT Climate-KIC Alumni
,
EIT Digital Alumni
,
CommUnity by EIT InnoEnergy
,
EIT Health Alumni
,
EIT RawMaterials Alumni
and representatives from
EIT Food
Alumni.
The first day started with a welcoming speech by
EIT Director Martin Kern
who emphasized the role of the Alumni members to lead the change to a greener, sustainable and more digitalised Europe, before giving the floor to the EIT Alumni Communities representatives to introduce the main activities and plans for the current and upcoming year.
Panel discussions
Throughout the two days, two panel discussions took place on the theme of the event
‘Responsible Consumption and Production’
, one focusing on the
‘Industry Perspective’

Both panels touched upon the themes with very valuable insights including:
Idea of developing mass personalisation instead of mass consumption
Importance of the distribution of infrastructure (idea of localism – localised production)
Emphasis on the need of documentation of product production
Idea of prosumer (a person who both produces and consumes a particular commodity)
Importance of reusing, reducing and recycling
The need for Doughnut economics (
'economy exceeds within the boundaries of society'
)
Advocating for degrowth movement (
'a really good believe system for both consumers and producers'
)
Workshops

YEAR: 2020
Sweden has submitted a new national strategy developed in cooperation with
EIT InnoEnergy
on batteries to the Swedish Government.
It shows how Sweden can take a leading position in the development of the sustainable battery value chain. The battery regulations proposed by the
European Commission
on 10 December highlights the need of minimising both the social and the carbon footprint of the battery industry. The national strategy is supported by companies across the value chain as well as universities and environmental organisations.
National strategy for the Swedish battery industry
Last week a proposal of the
new battery regulation
was adopted by the European Commission. The proposal is ambitious – it aims at minimising both the carbon footprint and the social footprint of the batteries. This is accelerated by the European Battery Alliance, launched by EU Commissioner Maroš Šefčovic in 2017, with the aim of building a sustainable battery value chain in Europe. The
Swedish strategy for a sustainable battery value chain
shows how actions in Sweden will contribute to the European battery industry development.
The development of sustainable battery production is not only important for achieving climate goals, but also enables the emergence of a competitive industry that creates growth and jobs throughout the battery value chain.
The big demand for electrification in the transport sector and industry processes have made battery manufacturing a bottle-neck. Sustainably produced batteries can become the next big Swedish industry expansion.
Svante Axelsson, National Coordinator for Fossil Free Sweden
Ideally placed to take a leading position
In Bloomberg NEF´s ‘Global Lithium-Ion Battery Supply Chain Ranking’ Sweden is projected to climb from number 10 to number 4 by 2025, only lagging behind China, Japan and the U.S.
Sweden has a strong position, with access to raw materials, cheap and fossil-free electricity, expertise and policy instruments that promote continued electrification with high environmental requirements. In addition, Sweden has strong actors along the entire value chain, from recycling and mining to the manufacture of active materials, complete battery cells and battery packs, to applications in the automotive industry as well as in the power system.
Supported by key actors across the value chain
The national strategy for a sustainable battery value chain is developed by the government initiative Fossil Free Sweden in cooperation with EIT InnoEnergy who also developed the foundation of the European Battery Strategy for the European Commission.
The strategy is supported by actors from the entire value chain from the Swedish mining industry to the battery-cell producer Northvolt, vehicle manufacturers like Volvo Cars, Volvo Group and Scania and electricity distributor Vattenfall as well as universities and environmental organisations.
Sweden is already today an integral part of the European battery ecosystem, but there is room for development in many parts of the value chain and here the strategy can be an important tool. We are impressed by the commitment of everyone involved and look forward how the example of this strategy work can be used as a role model for other European countries to follow.
Kenneth Johansson, CEO EIT InnoEnergy Scandinavia
Five areas in focus
The strategy makes a list of demands for national policy within five areas:
Sustainable batteries for a fossil-free energy and transport system: Stimulate demand for and use of sustainable batteries
Sustainable battery production, a new industry for Sweden: Create conditions for the development of a sustainable battery value chain in Sweden
Recovery and extraction of materials for a sustainable and circular battery industry: Create conditions to enable the mining industry and the recycling industry to contribute sustainably produced raw materials
Skills development for a charged future: Invest in research, innovation and education for skills development
Collaboration and dialogue for growth and export: Implement and follow up the action proposals through broad collaboration throughout the battery value chain

EIT RawMaterials
supported
Recycleye
is developing a computer vision system to build the world’s first fully automated material recovery facility (MRF).
Recycleye
, the intelligent waste management start-up, has secured GBP 1.2 million in seed funding, led by venture capital investors
MMC Ventures
,
Playfair Capital
and the London Waste and Recycling Board (
LWARB
), with participation from leading funds,
Atypical Ventures
,
eolos GmbH
and
Creator Fund
. The company has also received grants from
InnovateUK
and the European Union.
Recycleye is developing a computer vision system and affordable robotics to build the world’s first fully automated material recovery facility. Adopting technology from fields such as autonomous vehicles, Recycleye’s vision system can detect and classify all items in waste streams – broken down by material, object and even brand.
I was impressed by Recycleye’s expertise, and their incredible ability to federate around them, the best academic, technological and industrial skills, as well as to transpose all this knowledge in very concrete cases. I am delighted to support the growth of Recycleye, convinced that they will be able to provide breakthrough technologies to further the creation of an ever more circular economy.
Bernard Harambillet, Recycleye’s advisor and former CEO of Veolia Waste Management
Unlocking the full potential of waste sorting infrastructure
Until now, Recycleye’s advanced team of world-class research engineers have been working in stealth mode with the company’s partners to build and deploy the vision system in under a year. Their early academic partnerships, comprised of nine computer scientists, with
Imperial College London
and the
Delft University of Technology
, were pivotal in building Recycleye’s technology. Recycleye has also benefitted from an early partnership with Microsoft, which provided technological capabilities that has scaled the company from research and development to commercialisation. Notably, the company has partnered with leading accelerator programmes such as
EIT RawMaterials Accelerator
, that are bolstering Recycleye’s mission to turn rubbish back into resources.
Discover the EIT RawMaterials Accelerator programme
Helping societies to become more sustainable is a priority for Imperial College London through its Transition to Zero Pollution programme. I am pleased that Imperial alumnus company Recycleye is building on its founders’ experiences of the College’s entrepreneurship programmes. The company’s founders are also working closely with Imperial academics, especially from the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, to contribute to the circular economy by developing AI techniques for Recycleye’s vision system to detect and classify waste stream items.
Simon Hepworth, Director of Enterprise at Imperial College London
The company is currently working with two of the three largest waste management players in the UK to provide total waste knowledge. Their initial pilot programmes, which have been deployed in the UK and France, have been installed to optimise waste facility operations. Using Recycleye’s computer vision system has enabled clients, for the first time, to examine their facility and strategic operations using live data of outgoing waste flows.
At one deployment, Recycleye’s vision system can distinguish outgoing waste flows between food-grade high-density polyethylene (HDPE) plastic and non-food-grade HDPE plastic. Using computer vision to make this distinction, is enabling facilities to provide higher value bales and subsequently leverage this data to charge their clients based on the individual composition of every ton.
This technology could be a game-changer, not just for the recycling industry but for manufacturing and innovation in this country. Recycleye has the potential to radically improve the quality of materials that come out of a Materials Recycling Facility and refine sorting to such an extent that MRFs could, in future, provide highly specific materials ‘on demand’ to innovators who need recycled feedstock for their products. At LWARB we’re excited to be able to invest in Recycleye through the Greater London Investment Fund and we’ll be watching with interest as the system expands over the next few years.
Wayne Hubbard, CEO at LWARB, who are a GLIF investor
Recycleye is innovating automated turnkey solutions that will unlock the full potential of existing waste sorting infrastructure. At the core of the company’s mission is to digitise and decentralise the recycling industry by using 21st century technology that enables autonomous decision making. Recycleye are creating technologies that create total knowledge, total automation and total control for every materials recovery facility.

The
EIT Jumpstarter
has named the seven highest-promising start-ups in the field of health, food, raw materials, energy, urban mobility, manufacturing and New European Bauhaus.
EIT Jumpstarter, the talent scout programme for high-potential early-stage teams has chosen these seven solutions to be the winners in 2021, at the Grand Final, held on Wednesday. The goal of the programme is to help young innovators from those EU regions, which are moderate in terms of innovations, to turn their scientific ideas and discoveries into successful businesses. Winners were chosen in seven categories: health, food, raw materials, energy, urban mobility, manufacturing and New European Bauhaus (focused on sustainable and inclusive living spaces).
A solution for paralysed patients to communicate independently (
BirgerMind
, EIT Health), an innovation that aggregates the battery capacity of parked electric vehicles to intelligently manage energy (
Mjolnir Energy
, EIT InnoEnergy) or a project that uses larvae of flies to convert food waste into protein-rich animal food (BioConvert, New European Bauhaus) were among the winners. Other first prize awarded solutions are: a test that screens simultaneously 80 antibiotic residues (FlowForLife, EIT Food), a start-up that aims to become the leading supplier of the cleanest nanoparticles in the EU (Nano-Pure-Precision, EIT Raw Materials), an innovation that generates optimal robot programs automatically (RoboTwin, EIT Manufacturing) or a network of high-end (e-)bike parking facilities, with a focus on safety (T-Park, EIT Urban Mobility).
This has been a truly unique year in the life of EIT Jumpstarter, which celebrates its fifth edition: not only did we welcome participants from new regions but a new category, New European Bauhaus, has been added to the programme. These developments have made this highly competitive programme even richer. The fact that a record number of applications was received this year is proof that EIT Jumpstarter is a reference point for many. This gives us tremendous motivation to continue our work with even more impetus to boost innovation on Progressing European regions.
Dora Marosvolgyi, Cross-KIC Strategic Regional Innovations Director at EIT Health InnoStars.
Since 2017 the programme has trained 570 start-ups.

YEAR: 2021
The European Commission has released today its new Urban Mobility Framework, delivering on the
Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy Action Plan
released in December 2020.
The framework is part of the
Package for Efficient and Green Mobility
which includes a revision of the TEN-T regulation, ITS Directive and an action plan to boost long-distance and cross-border passenger rail services.
Transportation determines how cities look like, how liveable, equitable and healthy they are.  If recommendations are taken on board, the new communication can foster more sustainable urban mobility and is a welcomed push for more action from Member States.
Notably, the Commission plans to strengthen the role of Sustainable Urban Mobility Plans (SUMP) and  publish  by the end of 2022 a recommendation to Member States on the national programmes to support regions and cities in the roll-out of effective sustainable urban mobility plans that would help achieve EU goals. Further work will be done to refine comprehensive indicators for urban mobility data collection (SUMI), improve zero emission logistics (including data collection) and the safety of micro-mobility devices.
The amended TEN-T Regulation proposes to improve urban mobility in urban nodes as Member States have to ensure better connectivity and multi-modal hubs among others. SUMPs (or an equivalent “long-term, all-encompassing integrated mobility plan for the entire functional urban area,” including indicators and targets to measure progress) will be required for all urban nodes by 2025. The number of urban nodes will also increase, as all cities above 100 000 inhabitants (or capitals of an NUTS2 region) on the TEN-T will be considered an urban node if the proposal is adopted (raising the number of urban nodes to approximately 400 from the initial list of 88). According to the new TEN-T Regulation, urban nodes should also be able to collect data covering at minimum greenhouse gas emissions, congestion, deaths and serious injuries caused by road crashes, modal share for all modes, and access to mobility services.
“The new urban node approach is a long-awaited one that finally puts the urban dimension at the centre of the TEN-T. Only by tackling local transport we can arrive at the ambitious 90% emissions reduction in 2050. As urban areas grow, they will continue to generate substantial traffic volumes. It is key to be proactive and pre-empt and curb bottlenecks by improving first and last mile connectivity through sustainable and innovative solutions for both freight and passenger transport.’’
Dr Maria Tsavachidis, CEO of EIT Urban Mobility
The measures needed to achieve the decarbonisation of transport in cities like fleet electrification, modal shift, encouraging more active modes and better mass transit can raise costs and need step wise investments. An EIT Urban Mobility study modelling the urban mobility transition towards the Green Deal goals estimates that European cities need extra investments of EUR 86 billion in sustainable urban mobility compared to business-as-usual, leading to net benefits of up to EUR 177 billion by 2030. Of these net benefits, cities have the potential to generate EUR 79 billion in saved health costs linked to externalities avoided such as pollution and traffic accident fatalities. On average, each euro invested in the transition can generate up to EUR 3,06 by 2030 (i.e. up to EUR 2,14 in revenues, and EUR 0,92 in externalities savings).

The
Knowledge and Innovation Communities
(KICs) of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) are now able to assess the start-ups and scale-ups they support and fast track them directly to the full application stage of the
EIC Accelerator
.
The ‘Fast Track scheme’ helps to significantly speed up the process and reduce administrative burden for applicants wishing to apply to the EIC Accelerator. Introduced under
Horizon Europe
,
the scheme allows the EIC to give a streamlined treatment to applications stemming from projects already funded by the EIT KICs (and other eligible EU schemes) under Horizon Europe or Horizon 2020.
EIC and EIT have reinforced their collaboration to support the best European entrepreneurs. This will enable innovators, innovative SMEs and start-ups to receive quality support services to deploy and scale up innovations faster and with greater impact.
-  Mariya Gabriel, Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth
The Fast Track scheme recognises that start-ups and scale-ups emerging from the EIT Innovation Communities already have a proven track record, which gives them a faster access to the EIC Accelerator funding. Subject to an identification and review process undertaken by each EIT Innovation Community, companies will be invited to directly submit their full proposal to the highly competitive EIC Accelerator without going through the initial ‘short proposal’ stage of the evaluation procedure. They can also directly benefit from three days of tailored-made coaching to prepare the full proposal.
Once fast-tracked to the EIC Accelerator, applicants have up to one year to develop and submit their full proposals. This gives them time to apply to any of the regular EIC Accelerator cut-off dates throughout the year.

EIT Climate-KIC
, through the Horizon 2020 project
EO4GEO
, has published a new strategy to support skills development for Earth Observation and Geoinformation (EO*GI) – an essential source of data information for climate change mitigation and adaptation.
Earth observation and geographic information have the potential to
provide tools, indicators and measurements to understand, forecast, mitigate and tackle local and global climate change challenges.
The tremendous amount of data and information collected by satellites or remote sensing devices through the EU
Copernicus Programme
can be used in multiple climate-related applications: monitoring forest fires, floods, or urban heat islands, or supporting decision making at a local, regional or national level to mitigate these risks and improve the liveability of our planet.
But this can only be achieved through a qualified workforce
that understands the potential of the EO*GI sector and knows how to use its resources.
To bridge this skills gap, the EO4GEO Alliance has been working on upskilling and reskilling EU’s workforce in the Earth Observation and Geoinformation sector, resulting in the release of the Space/ Geoinformation Sector Skills Strategy in November 2021. The strategic document’s vision is to foster growth within the sector by ensuring a workforce with the right skills, in the right place, at the right time – and defines the goals that will define a long-term action plan to address the skills needed by the sector.
According to the report:
“A skilled and educated workforce will enable the [EO*GI] sector to attract high value, innovative and knowledge-based businesses, adapt more readily to the challenging technological environment and respond better to societal challenges [such as climate change].”
The report is a practical guide that aims to stimulate leadership in the sector, including high-level goals and strategic operational objectives for skills development. Its aim is to develop capacity and skills on Earth Observation and Geoinformation by fostering the uptake and integration of Copernicus data and services in end-user applications.
The strategy further proposes skills development recommendations to unleash students’ and workers’ potential to become the innovators of tomorrow. The EO*GI sector is linked to many other domains that influence each other and are transforming rapidly (agriculture, energy, transport, local government, maritime, etc.): As a consequence, the knowledge, skills, and competencies that are required to help answer the challenges we face today need to adapt to change.
EO*GI is a key sector in achieving the objectives of the European Commission’s Green Deal and the Digital Strategy, as it is leveraging data and
information to enforce laws on nature protection
. The work undertaken by EO4GEO addresses various levels of education to promote the use of Earth observation and geographic information in Europe and ensure that the available data is integrated into climate services for citizens, businesses, organisations and local and national authorities.

YEAR: 2021
On 24 November 2021, Members of the European Parliament voted for the adoption of the
Critical Raw Materials report
put forward by MEP Hildegard Bentele.
Under the new proposal, the EU strategy will boost strategic autonomy and resilience in the supply of Critical Raw Materials (CRMs).
Critical raw materials are vital in high technology applications for automotive, renewable energy, defence and aerospace. Securing a sustainable supply of CRMs is fundamental for Europe’s transition towards a green, digital and circular economy.
We have now a consistent and ambitious package that tackles the urgency of stable and sustainable critical raw materials supply chains while at the same time ensuring Europe’s competitiveness and jobs. All forecasts predict a higher demand for critical raw materials due to the twin transition. We, therefore, pledge to enhance our efforts to make full use of the circular economy, but since recycling effects will kick in only in a mid- to long-term perspective, we also ask to increase sustainable sourcing.
Hildegard Bentele, Member of the European Parliament
A strong emphasis was made on enhancing both primary and secondary markets of critical raw materials as well as on securing investments in the sector in general. The European Commission was urged to ensure that CRM policies are part of national resilience and recovery plans under NextGenerationEU, that investments in recycling capacities are being made, that new finance instrument with regard to risk sharing are promoted, that former coal mining regions are targeted. Member States will play a vital role in the implementation of the report, especially with regard to speeding up permitting procedures while guaranteeing environmental and social standards. Since Member States are conducting till today independent CRM policies, it is pointed out that more coordination at EU level is needed to monitor the CRM situation.
Hildegard Bentele called for increasing domestic sourcing, the need to diversify supply chains and boosting recyclingefforts in the EU. Europe’s dependence on strategic mineral resources poses geopolitical pressure. Hildegard Bentele considers that one of the prerequisites of strengthening domestic sourcing is a political framework that will enable responsible mining as well as raising awareness and sharing best practices for sustainable sourcing in Europe.
The European Commission and the Member States were urged to create an Important Project of Common European Interest (IPCEI) on Critical Raw Materials to strategically and sustainably plan for demand for the twin transition, covering requirements, sources of supply and (social, environmental and financial) costs. The IPCEI should cover all the relevant topics to reduce criticality and dependence, such as recycling, reuse, substitution, reduction of material use and mining. IPCEI projects will help unlock the unfulfilled potential in CRM-rich EU countries that have large untapped sources and contribute to Europe’s open strategic autonomy and resilience.
The role of ERMA in Europe’s resilience and open strategic autonomy
As the demand for critical raw materials is growing, the European Raw Materials Alliance (ERMA) is addressing the main challenges connected to raw materials supply for Europe. ERMA was established to address the challenge of securing access to sustainable raw materials, advanced materials, and industrial processing know-how for EU industrial ecosystems.
ERMA supports the adoption of the report on Critical Raw Materials by Hildegard Bentele. Our vision to diversify Europe’s supply chains, create jobs, attract investments and enable the best framework for raw materials and the circular economy are well aligned with the strategic scope of the European Parliament.
The new report welcomes the creation of ERMA. In the light of the global geopolitical situation and high dependence on producers from rich non-EU countries, ERMA’s current focus on the most Critical Raw Materials, such as rare earth elements and magnets, will support the long-term supply relationships for a huge range of small and large manufacturers in the EU and reduce the current reliance on a few non-EU countries.
The European Raw Materials Alliance must be further strengthened, its projects in the field of permanent magnets now need to be implemented, and new initiatives in the area of storage and recycling need to be supported.
Hildegard Bentele, Member of the European Parliament
On 30 September, ERMA issued an Action Plan “
Rare Earth Magnets and Motors: A European Call for Action
”, which highlights the challenges related to the highly vulnerable global rare earth supply chain and provides specific actions that the EU, its Member States, industry, and innovation communities should implement to diversify EU supply chains.
Among the next steps for ERMA is the development of a new action plan on Materials for Energy Storage and Conversion. The work is already ongoing under the second ERMA Cluster with a comprehensive outlook on the supply chains for green energy technologies (fuel cells and electrolysers, battery materials, alternative energy storage and conversion, materials in solar energy).
The report on Critical Raw Materials underlines ERMA’s role as an ‘investment pipeline’ and supports this initiative as a great tool to unlock public and private investments for environmentally assessed and sustainable projects on Critical Raw Materials. ERMA has recently announced its plans to enable high standards in sustainability by establishing a raw materials investment fund planned to be launched in 2022.
To date, ERMA’s ecosystem comprises 600 partners from universities, RTOs, trade unions, NGOs, national authorities and ministries, financial institutions, associations and industry. The new report highlighted the importance of engaging a vast network of stakeholders in the area of Critical Raw Materials. Moreover, the Alliance wants to consolidate ERMA’s role, international impact and visibility. ERMA will work closely with the European Commission and DG GROW to target specific parts of the world that are important in their strategic development agenda, such as Australia, Canada, Ukraine and the United States.
ERMA welcomes new partners
to work closely on CRM projects and contribute to Europe’s open strategic autonomy in the most critical and vital supply chains. If you have a project related to Critical Raw Materials and are looking for investment, we encourage you to check our investment channel and submit your project proposal

YEAR: 2021
The European Commission has adopted a package of climate-related legislative and policy actions known as the
Fit for 55
. This package aims to reduce EU greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels.
Apart from emission reduction, the Fit for 55 includes concrete targets for energy storage and conversion, including electric mobility and renewable energy. An overall target of 40% for energy from renewable sources is also set in the package, indicating a significant increase in wind and solar power capacity.
This inherently implies a significant increase in the demand for minerals and metals. Hence, a resilient European raw materials sector is the primary enabler of greenhouse gas emissions reduction. A transition away from a fossil fuel-based energy economy will, in the next decade, be based on energy conversion technologies such as solar, wind and fuel cells, as well as energy storage in various forms such as batteries and hydrogen.
Sustainable battery value chains
Today, the production of batteries and conversion technologies are not sustainable, and this is one of the important topics we need to address when moving forward: How do we ensure that the whole value chain, from the mine to the vehicle or the energy system, is sustainable?
This question was highlighted at the EIT RawMaterials Baltic Sea Stakeholder Day in a panel discussion with Ulla Lassi, Professor and Head of the Unit at the University of Oulu, Piritta Salonen, Head of Process Technology at Finnish Minerals Group, and Darren Townsend, Chief Development Officer at NeoMetals.
The next step for the raw material industry is to develop and implement traceability. The customers need to know whether the product they are buying is sustainably produced or not.
Ulla Lassi, Professor and Head of Unit at the University of Oulu
Specifically for batteries, there are a lot of different chemistries being used, and the challenge is to better plan how to reuse and recycle the different components.
We need to be able to trace what is in the operating mass when recycling, avoid excess waste, collect waste in a smarter way, and use more effective processes. In the future, we can manage the need for raw materials if we develop, expand and ameliorate the recycling industry.
Ulla Lassi, Professor and Head of Unit at the University of Oulu
Traceability is key
For mineral users in the battery value chain, traceability provides an opportunity to communicate about the origin and production impacts of materials at all points of the supply chain, from the mine to the consumer.
Materials go through several stages of processing in the electric vehicle battery value chain, from the mine to the car and eventually into recycling. From a technology perspective, mapping and tracking activity across interconnected global supply chains is complex and requires a combination of tools like blockchain and machine learning.
The traceability of mineral raw materials and the provision of information on their environmental and social impact and carbon footprint, for example, are key ways of improving the responsibility of the electric vehicle battery value chain. It also helps us promote the recycling of valuable metals and the competitiveness of raw material production in Europe.
Piritta Salonen, Head of Process Technology at Finnish Minerals Group
Finnish Minerals Group has partnered up with Circulor to begin a long-term collaboration that builds on its existing solution for tracing mineral raw materials along the electric vehicle battery value chain.
Recycling for the future
There are several ongoing projects related to the recovery of metals in Finland. For example, a recovery plant is planned in Raahe that would turn slag from the steel plant into ferrovanadium. In turn, Tracegrow, which was recently established in Kärsämäki, utilises alkaline mass made from crushed alkaline batteries.
The simple process (battery crushing, grinding, leaching and solution purification) is now freely marketed by Tracegrow, supported by EIT RawMaterials, as is the zinc-manganese fertiliser product separated from the batteries. In the ideal case, this new recycling method for alkaline batteries will spread from Finland all over the world.
The recycling of by-products in itself promotes sustainability: recycling saves raw materials as well as the energy needed for their primary production. This development area has untapped potential, e.g. old slags from European processing industries can offer a good source for materials in the future.
One example is the vanadium-rich slag produced in the manufacturing of steel: the extracted vanadium can be recycled in the steel industry and in batteries. In the Vanadium Recovery Project in Finland led by Neometal, the company is working on the recovery of vanadium and sustainable production of vanadium chemicals from processing by-products (“slag”) from a leading Nordic steel maker SSAB. The Vanadium Recovery Project creates an option to secure critical materials without mining risk.
We have developed a proprietary and sustainable process for the recovery of valuable constituents from scrap from other companies and end-of-life lithium-ion batteries.
Darren Townsend, Chief Development Officer at NeoMetals
Approximately 75% of global vanadium supply is produced in China and Russia, and there exists a significant opportunity to supply the European and American markets from the recycled SSAB’s Scandinavian feedstocks.

This year,
EIT Health
introduced two unique programmes to improve medical students’ and healthcare experts’ understanding of Artificial Intelligence (AI):
HelloAI RIS
and
HelloAI Professional
.
The programme series bridges the gap between healthcare experts’ education and practical knowledge in operating and implementing AI. Expanded from a summer school to a complete education programme on AI in healthcare, HelloAI has impacted over 1,750 participants in the last four years.
This summer, 530 young talents and university students completed the HelloAI RIS series. HelloAI RIS targets participants from the countries included in the EIT Health
Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS)
, to close the gap between the most advanced regions and the regions that are achieving innovation at a more moderate pace.
HelloAI Profressional, the most comprehensive course available on AI application in healthcare, is tailored for experienced healthcare professionals, looking to implement AI in their roles. Close to 350 healthcare experts from all over Europe and beyond recently graduated from HelloAI Professional which EIT Health has recognised as a ‘High Quality Project’ following an evaluation by an international panel of independent experts.
Healthcare is generating an enormous volume of data annually with ever-increasing numbers. Thanks to the revolution of AI, countless applications are already available to support routine clinical practice. The potential is vast, the global market for AI in healthcare, which was valued USD 6.7 billion (approximately EUR 5.9 billion) in 2020, will grow at a growth rate of 41.8% to USD 120.2 billion (approximately EUR 106.05 billion) by 2028.
According to the EIT Health and McKinsey & Company report, ‘
Transforming healthcare with AI
’, AI has the potential to enrich and refocus the work of healthcare professionals towards their main motivation for realising their career – direct patient care.
The technology will facilitate the automation of mundane tasks for healthcare professionals who currently spend up to 70% of their time on administration.
Healthcare organisations must allow for fundamental shifts in how patients are cared for, and healthcare workers must leverage increasingly comprehensive pools of AI-mediated medical data to deliver better care.
Yet the explosion of data, in addition to the shortage of professionals, increasing costs, access and quality concerns are raising significant major issues in healthcare.
“AI has a huge potential to transform how healthcare is delivered. However, there is a tremendous gap in healthcare experts’ practical knowledge and education on operating and implementing innovative technologies. At EIT Health InnoStars, we support healthcare transformation in Central, Eastern and Southern Europe, by accelerating the innovation of digitised healthcare solutions and the education of healthcare professionals, empowering them to use new generation tools.”
Balázs Zoltán Fürjes, InnoStars Director, EIT Health InnoStars
Education is indicated as the most important factor for fast adoption of healthcare innovations. To address the highlighted issues and narrow the skills gap in medical IT education and multidisciplinary collaboration, EIT Health and GE Healthcare, in collaboration with KTH Institute, LEITAT Technology Center and University of Maastricht tailored an extensive educational and practical programme on AI application in the medical field: the HelloAI programmes.
Around 350 medical experts worldwide, from 37 different countries completed the HelloAI Professional course consisting of six live sessions, four self-learning modules, and 18+ hours of valuable content provided by the top speakers in their field. All covering various aspects of AI implementation in healthcare.
“Artificial intelligence is broadly expected to drive significant benefits across healthcare systems by increasing efficiency though decreasing the operational cost to improve patient outcomes. With such exponential acceleration on AI in daily clinical work – medical professionals must educate themselves and be prepared for future disruption in the industry. AI can make healthcare data-driven, value-based, and patient-centric. I’m confident that the HelloAI initiative can equip medical professionals with the right skillset to operationalise AI for faster, more accurate patient diagnoses and reduced administrative clinical burdens in the future”

EIT Urban Mobility is excited to announce its participation in the newly launched URBANE project.
URBANE (Upscaling Innovative Green Urban Logistics Solutions Through Multi-Actor Collaboration and Physical Internet (PI) – Inspired Last Mile Deliveries) is a 42-month project co-funded by the
Horizon Europe Programme
with a budget of around EUR 9 million.
It aims to develop novel last-mile delivery solutions combining green automated vehicles and shared space utilisation models. Leading European cities, research experts and knowledge partners, connectivity and automation solution providers, and industry leaders in logistics services kicked off the project in September 2022. It will be implemented by a consortium of 39 partners and an external partner from 12 different EU Member States, led by
INLECOM
.
EIT Urban Mobility
will contribute to the business models and commercialisation of the Living Labs' tested solutions and will also contribute to communication and dissemination activities.
Why do we need innovative last-mile delivery solutions?
The e-commerce industry has seen continuous economic growth—a tendency significantly bolstered by the COVID-19 pandemic. This comes with a vast transformation of the e-commerce sector, presenting enormous issues in urban supply chains. In light of these facts, Europe urgently needs to identify and scale-up novel last-mile transportation solutions. And as e-commerce continues to expand, so will its impact on sustainability. The last mile of e-commerce deliveries is the portion that produces the highest emissions. Higher demand is a driving cause.
URBANE will confront this issue head on. It will drive the quick adoption of zero-emission urban logistics solutions by 2030,  achieving improved road transport efficiency and logistics systems, in line with the objectives of the European Green Deal, the Paris Agreement, and the Green City Accord.
How will URBANE contribute to solving the problem?
URBANE’s goals are part of the wider European Commission’s project of achieving “Zero Emission Last Mile Deliveries” as components of the
European Green Digital Coalition
and the
European Climate Pact
goals. URBANE will support the transition by developing effective, resilient, safe, and sustainable last-mile transport through four Lighthouse Living Labs (LLs): Helsinki (FI), Bologna (IT), Valladolid (ES), and Thessaloniki (GR). These labs will demonstrate efficient, replicable, and socially acceptable innovative last-mile delivery solutions (Wave 1 solutions), building on existing assets.
Hands-on learning at the European level will be facilitated by an Innovation Transferability Platform. The platform uses Digital Twinning Tools, open models, smart contracts governed by blockchain technology, and a data-driven Impact Assessment Radar. These will enable the adaptation and replication of Wave 1 solutions in two Twinning LLs in Barcelona and Karlsruhe (Wave 2 LLs).
URBANE’s commitment to upscaling is further strengthened by the engagement of six early adopters, also known as the Follower Cities: Aarhus (DK), Antwerp (NL), La Rochelle (FR), Mechelen (BE), Prague (CZ), and Ravenna (IT). The cities are contributing to innovations’ adoption feasibility studies, stimulating the creation of new Living Lab communities across Europe.
Who is part of the URBANE project?
The consortium is made up of 39 partners and an external partner from 12 different EU Member States. It is led by INLECOM, a leading digital innovation provider, responsible for the twinning infrastructure and open models’ library of the project. The URBANE consortium includes:
• City Stakeholders & Urban Planners: COBO, KARL, VALLAD, HELS (with their affiliated
entity FVH), ITL, RCM, AMB, RAV, MECH, AAKS, PRAHA, ANTW, CDA
• Last-mile Logistics Value Chain Operators: VAN, DBSCH, ACS, TYP, DTS
• Physical Innovation Providers: SOBEN, LMAD, EUDRIVE, IFEVS

All around the globe, cities and regions are driving climate ambitions, promoting innovative solutions and mainstreaming sustainability into the everyday lives of citizens. Without the full engagement of subnational governments, it is nearly impossible for national governments to move quickly from commitments to achievements.
At COP27 in Egypt,
EIT Climate-KIC
joined the
European Committee of the Regions (CoR)
,
ICLEI
,
Under2Coalition
,
Climate Alliance
,
Climate Chance
,
Regions4
and the
Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA)
to discuss a joint Roadmap for COP28. Together, they launched the Declaration on the
EU Green Deal: from local to global
. The declaration calls for subnational governments to play a stronger role in international climate talks and in the implementation of the Paris Agreement.
The full engagement of subnational governments
The declaration acknowledges the efforts of countries to reach an agreement to align climate ambitions and to support a just transition that includes energy security. However, it concludes that the path to climate neutrality and a resilient future will take longer without the full engagement of their subnational governments.
EIT Climate-KIC and other signatories declare that they stand ready to:
Set up an Annual Subnational Climate Forum for dialogue between parties and local and regional authorities to support efforts at the national and international levels towards COP28
Cooperate with city networks and partners through the Global Covenant of Mayors in a collective effort to set up a Common Reporting Framework allowing to feed into the work on regionally and locally determined contributions
Report progress to
Race to Zero
and
Race to Resilience
, and implement their commitments
Foster subnational cooperation towards a holistic approach to climate action, and the creation of a Local Green Deal (building upon the EU Green Deal approach)
Cities make up about 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and by 2050 they will concentrate around 70% of the human population. At the same time, in the coming decades, regions will see major transitions in value chains, energy, and infrastructure. Cities and regions are already committing to ambitions for accelerated change well beyond National Development Plans.
We must help them stay the course and have a voice in doing so, and therefore, we call for subnational governments to be given an explicit and expanded role in international negotiations on the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Without a greater coordination and cooperation in the run up towards COP28, the ability of cities and regions to turn words into action will be significantly diminished.

These exciting projects will be able to use their EUR 10 000 Makerspace voucher to develop their ideas. They were recognised for their potential to contribute to the the New European Bauhaus initiative to create a beautiful, sustainable, and inclusive Europe.
The EIT Community New European Bauhaus hackathons support fresh ideas from students and local entrepreneurs and help develop these ideas in an intense and radically collaborative environment. With the EUR 10 000 voucher, teams will be able to access a Makerspace to turn their solution into concrete goods and services.
The four categories and winners from this year are:
Reconnecting with nature: URBAN TREE
URBAN TREE is a sustainable urban drainage system made of low CO2 concrete and covered in plants which can grow from the rainwater stored in them. This solution is particularly ideal for paved areas of cities as it can be placed directly on top of other pavements and does not require excavation like other drainage systems or trees. By combining the drainage system and greenery, the product aims to ease pressure on the sewage system, as well as contribute to a greener city.
Regaining a sense of belonging: Molo61
Focusing on the "Italia 61" zone in Turin, Molo61 wants to create a multi-functional and sustainable space for youth where they can study, work, or just spend time together. The project suggested co-working and co-design interventions made from sustainable materials and involving members of the community in the design process.
Circularity: PuliTO
The elodea plant has long been treated as a hazard to the river Po in Turin but can no longer be permanently eradicated from the area. Given this reality, PuliTO aims to give new life to this plant by using its extraction and research to educate citizens on the problem. It will also be able to use the aquatic plant to create products that are vital to the search for new supplementary vegetable proteins, bioplastics, and natural fertilizers.
Prioritising people and places that need it most: Orlegi
Orlegi aims to make cities greener through a gamified app where citizens can make suggestions on how to improve their neighbourhoods. Governments can access this data to then act on it. The app can give citizens suggestions for what neighborhood changes could be put in place, like bike lanes or extra greenery. Orlegi gives citizens the tools to reimagine their neighbourhoods while giving local authorities a better understanding of the area's needs.

In response to persisting regional disparities in innovation performance in Europe, the EIT launched the Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS) in 2014 to provide tailored capacity building support as well as widened  regional outreach to what the
European Innovation Scoreboard
(EIS) designates as “modest” and “moderate” innovator countries.
While the EIT looks ahead to new horizons for the
2022-2027 period
, it can already proudly present seven years of hard work uniting new partners across Europe within its innovation network. The EIT was working tirelessly between 2014 and 2020 to establish a presence in all EU Member States and beyond.
Download our newest RIS Success Stories publication
Countries which previously had very limited participation in the EIT Community increased their participation between 2014 and 2020 from 40 partners in those countries to over 900. The RIS has both increased the number of start-ups the EIT Community is supporting in RIS countries and facilitated access to business creation services. By 2020, it had supported 1 350+ start-ups and scale-ups.

YEAR: 2022
Czech company RoboTwin s.r.o. uses motion tracking as an alternative to classic automation.
The story of RoboTwin s.r.o., a Czech start-up developing industrial automation through motion tracking and imitation, seems to have all the ingredients for a happy ending. But no start-up can hope to traverse the gulf between the lab and the market alone. The support of the EIT and
EIT Manufacturing
was instrumental to the start-up’s success.
Many roads lead to entrepreneurship. For some people, it's a calling. Megi Mejdrechová, a Czech engineer, does not see herself as one of those people. If you had asked her just a few years ago, she probably would have said that nothing about entrepreneurship appealed to her. She enjoys the analytical and technical nature of the engineering field. "I really love technical tasks, development, solving challenges, and making something work," said Mejdrechová. And yet, in 2020, she ended up co-founding RoboTwin, where she is also CTO. Mejdrechová now builds on the technology she developed during her studies.
One question was instrumental in her decision to make the leap: was she creating anything useful? Something that improves industry, the environment, or people’s lives? “After graduating I had the chance to work on my own innovation, which I believe has the potential to make the manufacturing industry a better and safer place," said Mejdrechová. The power to follow her own beliefs and create a positive impact eventually made entrepreneurship attractive to her.
Being a young woman in the male-dominated high-tech field seemed to add to the challenge. However, Mejdrechová does not see it that way: “I think it can be an advantage. You’re more visible, people are interested, and you can be part of a powerful women co-founder community which is very supportive and welcoming.”
How a university student can change an industry
In 2019, a Czech spray painting company approached the Czech Technical University. The company’s purely manual processes meant that employees would spray paint products by hand – a laborious, dirty, and unhealthy job. The process was un-scalable and the company had to decline orders due to lack of workers. Since they could not find a suitable solution on the market, they turned to academia. It turned out that most small and medium-sized paint shops, 250 in Czechia alone, still manually paint using a spray gun. Many want to robotise their production, but the specialised nature of their work meant that it was too expensive and inefficient.
Mejdrechová, who was a student at the Czech Technical University at the time, took up the challenge of developing a solution. She set out to help automate a manufacturing industry still reliant on a human workforce. If she was successful, she could reduce the number of hours painters spend in unhealthy or even toxic environments doing repetitive tasks. “I was very excited about this topic and took this very seriously. It was simply not acceptable to me that so many people are still working in such conditions,” said Mejdrechová.
She designed a way to robotise small-scale industrial painting easily and efficiently. “With the support of my supervisor, I tried out this motion tracking-based approach," explains Mejdrechová. "We consulted with the paint shop, which helped me a lot to focus on a user-friendly solution”. Eventually, a prototype was successfully tested in a painting cell. It is on this technology that RoboTwin’s solution is based.
An alternative approach to automation
Many industries have long developed and adopted automation techniques. One classic example is robots working at conveyor belts. This approach to automation replaces trained workers with “generalist” robots. For specialised tasks, such as spray painting or coating, this means replacing experienced and skilled specialists. The robot that’s replacing them has no knowledge of the task and the programmer is unable to create a suitable programme (since there is no one to tell them how).
RoboTwin provides an alternative approach to automation based on motion tracking and imitation. While an experienced worker demonstrates how the paint job is done on the first product in the series, RoboTwin tracks their motion and processes this data into a robotics programme. The robot is then able to imitate their exact motions and can finish the other products in the series.
Jumpstarting a promising venture
As a student researcher, Mejdrechová never gave much thought to technology transfer or the gap between technology and industrial practice. But she received a lot of positive feedback from paint shops and heard how much they wanted her solution to actually be available on the market. She then realised that her solution would probably not get that chance unless she took the initiative. “Eventually, it was my friend who convinced me that no one else but me, who brought the project up to the stage of a prototype, has the highest chance to push it towards a successful end,” remembers Mejdrechová.
Mejdrechová formed a team of three and joined EIT Jumpstarter, where they ended up winning the Grand Final. With their technology’s potential confirmed, they officially established RoboTwin s.r.o. The lessons and support from EIT Jumpstarter turned out to be invaluable for RoboTwin.
Looking back, participating in the EIT Jumpstarter programme was a game changing experience for us. It helped us validate our plans in the early stage and gave us very good advice on what to focus on further.
Megi Mejdrechová, Co-founder and CTO of RoboTwin s.r.o
The team noticed that gathering feedback from their customers didn't just improve their tech. It helped them build relationships. Mejdrachová's advice today for anyone who wants to start a project is to first draw on the expertise of seasoned experts. “To create an informed outlook, it is necessary to find mentors and experts that are willing to help," said Mejdrachová. "We were lucky to gain support from EIT Manufacturing CLC East. Their support is priceless”.
EIT Manufacturing is one of EIT’s nine Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), which bring together businesses, research centres, and universities to strengthen cooperation in the European manufacturing ecosystem. EIT Manufacturing’s Co-Location Center (CLC) East, based in Vienna, is one of six innovation hubs. It services seven countries in Central and Eastern Europe.
Getting noticed at Discover Vienna
In 2022, the RoboTwin team spent five days in Vienna as part of the Discover Vienna: Manufacturing Edition programme during the ViennaUP’22 start-up festival. They found themselves surrounded by other promising start-ups from Central and Eastern Europe. The team took part in the festival's networking and meet-and-greets with corporate representatives, incubators, and successful founders, as well as a pitching competition. "Discover Vienna broadened our horizons tremendously. We exchanged experiences with other start-ups sharing our difficult path and got some very practical tips,” says Mejdrechová. “Especially since RoboTwin is a very young start-up, we value opportunities to present ourselves and validate our plan while pitching in front of an expert jury. My stay in Vienna was very enriching”.
During Discover Vienna, RoboTwin competed in BoostUp! East, the regional edition of EIT Manufacturing’s competition for start-ups and scale-ups. They took home first prize in the SwitchOn category – the competition for early-stage start-ups.
As part of the Discover Vienna: Manufacturing Edition, RoboTwin received two-month's worth of support from EIT Manufacturing. EIT Manufacturing tailored its support to RoboTwin, focusing on the development and deliverables of a business development strategy. That included their business plan, profit and loss sheet, cashflow sheet, and their pitch deck.
EIT Manufacturing has experience with business creation; they know the European market and understand the needs of a high-tech start-up. We trust them and discuss our doubts openly and to the point.
Megi Mejdrechová, Co-founder and CTO of RoboTwin s.r.o
In 2022, RoboTwin was selected for, and went on to win EIT Manufacturing RIS LEADERS. LEADERS is a competition under the Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS) for women innovators in manufacturing, operating in European countries with moderate to modest levels of innovation.
Closing the gap between prototype and market
RoboTwin applied for EIT Manufacturing’s Call for Proposals 2023. The Call supports innovative manufacturing-related projects in the prototype stage, helping them put their products on the market within a year. According to Mejdrechová, the Call for Proposals 2023 is an incredible fit for RoboTwin. “Our vision is to build an outstanding product that not only extends our prototype and fulfills the market’s needs, but is something that initiates our journey towards a sustainable company," said Mejdrechová. Participants in RoboTwin's consortium provide the start-up their experience and expertise.
Mejdrechová firmly believes that the future for RoboTwin is bright. “Every year I spent working on our project was more exciting than the previous one," said Mejdrechová. "I believe that, thanks to the various means of support from EIT Manufacturing, we have everything to keep this trend going in 2023. The provided funding could give us an exceptional boost to achieve our goals and fulfill our dream: to bring RoboTwin to market and enable the automation of difficult, unhealthy, and repetitive jobs in manufacturing all over the world.”

Polish start-up
Restimo,
a graduate of the 2020 edition of the
EIT Digital Venture Programme
, has raised EUR 255 000 to develop its RestHub application for the catering industry.
Backers of the company include
EIT Digital
and business angels Małgorzata Sitkowska, Nicolas Jedraszak, and Michał Zawiasa, who successfully developed their own food-tech businesses.
Resthub is an all-in-one solution that allows restaurants to manage the entire ordering process in one place
,
integrating food delivery platforms, courier companies, and Point of Sale (POS) systems. Instead of having to deal with up to a dozen different systems and devices on a daily basis, waiters using RestHub can manage everything with a single tablet.
While working at Glovo's headquarters in Barcelona, I noticed how challenging it is for restaurants to handle multiple tablets. Order management, menu updates, or reporting separately for each application used to take waiters many additional hours and even days of work per month. We have simplified it to a few seconds.
Arek Bielecki, co-founder of Restimo
Restimo serves restaurant chains like North Fish, Makarun, and Charlotte among others, and is present in over 25 cities in Poland. The acquired capital will fund further product development, expand the sales and customer service team, and support the marketing of Resthub. The company is also preparing for foreign expansion, targeting all of Central and Eastern Europe and Scandinavia.
14 Polish companies have been founded to date as a result of the support from EIT Digital's Venture Programme, and it's great to see a company such as Restimo using that support as a springboard for subsequent growth.
Mirko Tadic, EIT Digital Venture Program Lead
We are glad that such experienced entrepreneurs are joining our group of investors. Their industry experience and contacts will allow us to achieve our goals even faster.
Tomasz Marcińczyk, co-founder of Restimo

A new joint statement commits the European Commission and the European PV industry to supporting investment across the solar PV value chain.
What is EIT InnoEnergy's role as Secretariat?
EIT InnoEnergy is the EIT's Knowledge & Innovation Community (KIC) for sustainable energy across Europe. As the Secretariat of the Alliance, EIT InnoEnergy will facilitate business and industrial cooperation across the solar PV value chain, lead the implementation of a new strategic industrial action plan, manage membership, gather and disseminate market intelligence, manage communications, and run the Alliance’s ‘Business and Investment Platform’. This will make Europe more competitive and ready to meet the booming demand for solar PV in Europe and the world. In the short term, the plan is to develop an industry that can supply an annual capacity of 30 GW by 2025, adding EUR 60 billion of new GDP every year to Europe and creating more than 400 000 new jobs (both directly and indirectly).
SolarPower Europe and the European Solar Manufacturing Council will join EIT InnoEnergy on the Alliance’s steering committee in recognition of their role as key industry stakeholders. Together, the steering committee will oversee the delivery of the Alliance’s work and the European Solar PV Forum, a large, annual public event that will facilitate high-level policy and political discussions.
Third countries are giving massive support to develop their clean tech industries and attract ours. The EU needs to up its game in terms of investment and regulatory environment for our clean tech manufacturing to thrive, create jobs in Europe, and compete globally. The new European Solar PV Industrial Alliance is a key initiative to decrease dependencies and boost EU manufacturing capacity of solar PV technologies to 30 Gigawatt annually by 2025 across the full value chain.
Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for the Internal Market
The Alliance will follow a seven-pronged strategic action plan to boost PV manufacturing investment across Europe:

Over a hundred innovators from Central, Eastern, and Southern Europe gathered in Kraków, Poland to turn their ideas into businesses at the EIT Jumpstarter. The most promising early-stage start-ups won nearly EUR 200 000.
On 29 November,
the sixth EIT Jumpstarter
came to an end with pitches from 42 finalists in seven different categories – health, food, raw materials, energy, urban mobility, manufacturing, and the New European Bauhaus (an EU initiative to create sustainable and inclusive living spaces).
For the last couple of years, we noted an increasing interest from teams from the Western Balkans. But this year was exceptional in terms of innovators coming from this part of Europe. Many Jumpstarters joined the programme with clear and feasible ideas, and some had already funded their company, even before the Grand Final.
Dóra Marosvölgyi, Director of the EIT Community’s Regional Strategic Innovation Projects
Bulgarian start-up
Green Kilometers
won the Best Cross-Thematic Business Idea prize, a special award for impactful innovators. Green Kilometers worked with local municipalities to create a social-benefit system that rewards inhabitants for using non-motorised, “green” urban transportation. Those rewards include cultural event tickets, art classes, and even tax reductions.
Start-ups were not the only ones getting awards. The University of Warsaw, Regional Innovation Scheme (RIS) Hub for EIT Food, was named Best RIS Hub.
The institution actively participated in all stages of the programme, supporting the teams throughout their development with high efficiency, and many teams they trained made it to the Grand Final. With the award, we would like to recognise their very professional, precise, and inspiring attitude and work.
Anna Mihok-Peli, Programme Coordinator of EIT Jumpstarter
Jump-starting market success
The EIT Jumpstarter is a programme run by six EIT Knowledge & Innovation Communities (KICs): EIT Health, EIT RawMaterials, EIT Food, EIT InnoEnergy, EIT Manufacturing, and EIT Urban Mobility. The goal is to help early-stage innovators from emerging European regions turn their scientific ideas and innovations into successful businesses.
For seven months, selected start-ups work with mentors in local trainings on business modeling and business planning. Start-ups are then evaluated based on the quality of the business plan they created during that time. The six best plans are qualified for the Grand Final – this year hosted in Kraków, Poland –, where they compete for the prize of EUR 10 000 in each of the seven categories.
More than 750 innovators have joined the programme during the last six years, and there are several success stories. While some of the alumni keep refining their business idea, over 45 have formalised companies and continue to expand.

EIT Climate-KIC leads the NetZeroCities Pilot Cities Programme, currently supporting over 50 European cities in their quest for climate neutrality by 2030, as part of the
EU Cities Mission
. This two-year initiative provides funding, support, and training to a diversity of cities, facilitating collective learning experiences.
The Pilot Cities Programme provides participating cities with funding and support from EIT Climate-KIC through the NetZeroCities platform. Amsterdam, Madrid, Rome and Warsaw are among the 53 cities participating in the Pilot City Programme.
Some cities have applied as
multi-city Pilots
; German, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, Slovenian, and Polish cities have applied in groups in an effort to ramp up their collaboration. Most cities have applied on their own but will go through the programme together as a cohort. Along the way they are collectively challenged to understand the role a city can take in its journey to climate neutrality.
Over two years, they will receive capacity-building training and support from dedicated city experts. This will help them identify the source of their main emissions and map out potential solutions that should lead to emissions mitigation.
Galway
, for example, will focus on retrofitting private homes in a decarbonisation area.
Liberec
and
Guimarães
are setting up energy communities to test out a range of solutions from transport and energy consumption in buildings to improved waste management.
Learning how to reach climate neutrality
The approach the programme takes is about exploring different pathways and understanding how local ecosystems work so that cities can have more clarity on how to deliver the desired changes. Through it, cities aim to set up new services or entities, conceive of new tools to aid decarbonisation, or set up local projects.
Cities have already taken part in learning activities offered by the programme. From some of these early sessions, similarities have begun to emerge. The need to define what role a city administration should be playing in the transition, the need for good practices that will boost citizen involvement and the difficulty in identifying and engaging the right stakeholders that should be involved in the climate transition as partners are some of the recurring themes.
The goal of this process is that cities are able to use all of their findings to ultimately guide their decision making, guide their investments, and involve a wider audience, be it citizens or communities, but also more importantly the decision makers and politicians who influence those processes they are trying to change
Nikhil Chaudhary, Strategic Learning Lead in NetZeroCities
Collaboration for transformation
In the spirit of being a space for participating cities to practice on the ground approaches to systems change, the programme provides a deep learning syllabus, including boot camps, summer and winter schools, peer learning and sensemaking sessions. Through these, cities generate key insights about how change is happening, what can be extracted from this and applied more broadly, and in turn build capability and capacity for the work of systemic change across the entire city. In addition, as cities learn what works (and what doesn’t) in their context, these innovative pathways they are experimenting with can then be scaled and replicated by other cities, thereby maximising the reach and impact of their work, and the wider Pilot Cities Programme.

During a launch session, the city of Braga unveiled three urban mobility solutions set to undergo testing as part of
EIT Urban Mobility
’s innovative initiative.
The kick-off event was presented by Ricardo Rio, City of Braga’s Mayor, Olga Pereira, Councillor for Mobility of the Municipality of Braga and María Paula Caycedo, Head of EIT Urban Mobility Innovation Hub South, at the Town Hall premises.
The project is financed with EUR 180 000 of European investment to the city for the three pilot projects that will be implemented for 6 months to tackle active mobility, cycling and parking spaces.
Braga City Council will test three innovative solutions in the area of sustainable mobility in a stride towards sustainable and efficient urban living. The projects, presented in an event hosted at the city town hall, were selected by EIT Urban Mobility as part of one of the major innovation programmes. The RAPTOR project – previously called #ChallengeMyCity – aims to test innovative solutions from start-ups and SMEs with a six-month pilot project to evaluate its social, economic, and environmental impact in the city and estimate long-term integration into Braga’s mobility strategy.
Bicycle safety and monitoring the flow of cyclists, promoting active mobility in the city centre and improving the monitoring and use of loading and unloading bays are the three projects.
Based on the results achieved, we’ll be able to develop mobility policies better suited to our municipality
Ricardo Rio, Mayor of Braga
About the implemented solutions
The first project (“
Telraam
”) for bicycle safety and cyclist flow monitoring will install 15 sensors in the city centre to count and categorise metrics, namely road user count, means of transport, and estimated speed.
The “
Walkflow
” project is a solution for analysing pedestrian movement patterns in the city centre using anonymous mobile location data and application aggregator data. This initiative will make it possible to characterise the type of user, the origin/destination, the purpose of the activity or the frequency of journeys.
Finally, “
Parkunload
” aims to test 25 smart parking zones for more efficient use of loading and unloading areas, reducing congestion in the city centre. Using a mobile application and Bluetooth sensors, this system will enable managing, regulating, and analysing car parks in loading and unloading zones.

YEAR: 2024
The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) has successfully launched 16 innovation hubs across Central, Eastern and Southern Europe dedicated to tackling Europe’s regional innovation divide.
The new hubs, known as EIT Community Hubs are an integral part of the EIT Regional Innovation Scheme and have been launched in the following countries:
Bulgaria, Croatia,
Cyprus
, Czechia, Estonia , Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Malta, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Slovenia, Türkiye,  Ukraine, and Spain and Portugal covering their respective
EU’s Outermost Regions
.
The new EIT Community Hubs will serve as a central gateway to Europe’s largest innovation ecosystem supporting local innovators and entrepreneurs to scale their innovations and launch new products to the market.  EIT Community Hubs represents all EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) under one roof, boosting cooperation among local businesses, education authorities, and research organisations, enhancing the region’s competitiveness and contributing to Europe’s economic growth and competitiveness.
The EIT Regional Innovation Scheme has grown in the past ten years to be one of the most successful innovation instruments connecting and collaborating, between researchers, entrepreneurs and companies in the widening countries.
RIS-eligible countries currently account for 60% of the EIT’s total participation, well above the Horizon Europe average of 40% – and many RIS-supported ventures have realised their potential and found breakthrough commercial success. This year we celebrate ten years of impact, ten years of helping grow companies and launching new innovations to the market
Stefan Dobrev, Chairman of the EIT Governing Board
By connecting regional actors, innovators, and partners to Europe’s largest innovation ecosystem, the EIT RIS strengthens ecosystems in low-innovation performance countries’ ability to innovate and paves the way for synergies between new networks and local and regional smart specialisation strategies.
A Decade Of Impact
2024 marks ten years of impact for the EIT Regional Innovation Scheme – a dedicated programme offering tailor made support and widened regional outreach to ‘moderate’ and ‘emerging’ innovator countries as designated by the European Innovation Scoreboard.
Today, the EIT, under Horizon Europe is strongly addressing Europe’s innovation divide, having invested over one billion euros into building up innovation ecosystems across Europe.  Over 700 innovation projects have been supported by the EIT Reginal Innovation Scheme, helping to launch over 500 products and services to the market, and supporting over 3 360 start-ups and scale-up including creating over 250 new start-ups. The
EIT Regional Innovation Scheme’s mid-term evaluation results
were recently published,  documenting the programme’s effectiveness in strengthening the capacity of innovation enablers and actors,
such as business
accelerators, incubators, start-ups, scale-ups, SMEs, and educational and research institutions.

YEAR: 2024
The iconic British Library in London, UK is embarking on a renewable energy transition thanks to EIT Awards winner 2012
Naked Energy
, a company in the
EIT Climate-KIC portfolio
. This solar start-up will deliver a landmark installation boasting 950 solar collectors across 712.5 m2 of the library’s roof space.
It is expected to reduce the building’s CO2 emissions by 55 tonnes and generate 216 megawatt hours (MWh) of energy annually – the equivalent of powering and heating a community centre or swimming pool for a year.
The urgent need to decarbonise heat has long been under-recognised in the discussions over the UK’s move toward net zero. We hope that this project can serve as a catalyst to inspire others in the public sector to join the energy transition and move away from fossil fuels once and for all.
Christophe Williams, Founder and CEO of Naked Energy.
The company is redefining solar energy power with Virtu – the world’s highest energy density solar technology. The Virtu product range converts the sun’s energy into heat and electricity from the same collector, saving up to four times more carbon emissions than standard solar PV panels.
The technology will supply sanitary hot water and space heating for the British Library, benefitting staff and visitors alike. In a rare application of solar technology, the collectors will also be used to help maintain the precise temperature and humidity conditions required to preserve the British Library’s national collection.
It’s an honour to partner with such an iconic British institution and be a part of their journey to meet their net zero goals. This project has been an immense undertaking and is an exciting step forward for the solar thermal industry in the UK.
Christophe Williams, Founder and CEO of Naked Energy.
Scaling to new heights
Naked Energy was one of the first start-ups to complete all three stages of the EIT Climate-KIC’s Accelerator back in 2012. Nearly a decade later, they joined our portfolio of more than 100 climate ventures and continue to showcase the
untapped potential of the solar thermal industry
.
The collaboration with the British Library is a prime example of how we’re connecting our robust portfolio of climate solutions to the needs of government agencies, corporates and investors alike – forging a more efficient and effective path towards achieving local climate ambitions across the globe.

YEAR: 2024
Study of 7,165 start-ups across 37 countries reveals that the percentage of women founders in deep tech has doubled since 2010, however, women remain underrepresented in the field at 17.4% (average for 2010-2022) of all deep tech start-ups.
The new study,
‘Women Founders in European Deep Tech Start-ups’
reveals that women founders in the field receive less total funding compared with men founders. According to the study, women are underrepresented in deep tech start-ups, with less than one quarter (24%) of deep tech start-ups created in 2022 having at least one woman in the founding team.
The study has been brought forward by the
European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT)
, a body of the European Union; the European Investment Fund (EIF) and European Investment Bank (EIB) Advisory Services. The main findings are now available and are being presented at the
EIT INNOVEIT
conference in Helsinki today. The full Study will be launched during the third edition of the
Empowering Equity event
, organised by the EIF and EIB Advisory on December 5th.

Find Full Report Here
The EIT conference,
INNOVEIT — Pioneering women: driving innovation and investment in Europe
— is an event focused on the EIT’s role and impact in boosting women-led innovation and investment across Europe. The conference is showcasing the EIT as Europe’s largest innovation community in Europe and its innovation opportunities in deep tech, women entrepreneurship, sustainability and more.
7,165 start-ups founded since 2010 were analysed as part of the study using the Dealroom database (a global provider of data and intelligence on start-ups and tech ecosystems) across 37 European countries.
This EIT study is a call to overcome the gender gap for investment in deep tech. The percentage of total funding going to deep tech start-ups with women founders stands at only 11.4%. This is a missed innovation opportunity that Europe simply cannot afford. That’s exactly where the EIT comes in. Our programmes, including SUPERNOVAS, are dedicated to strengthening women-led start-ups,  providing access to funding, access to markets and clients, mentoring, thematic expertise, all as part of a community of partners across Europe.
Martin Kern, EIT Director
Women remain underrepresented but the trend is moving upwards
Whilst women founders remain a minority, the study finds that the percentage of women over the total number of founders of deep tech start-ups has doubled between 2010 and 2022 (from 7% to 14%). Similarly, whilst women are less likely to start a deep tech start-up on their own, the percentage of solo woman start-ups has been steadily increasing.
The study notes that deep tech start-ups with at least one woman founder are significantly larger in terms of number of people employed, and that larger founding teams are associated with higher employee growth.
The study has also found that most women-led deep tech start-ups launched between 2010 and 2022 come from France with 2,616 (21.0%), followed by Germany  and Spain. Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, Finland and Belgium are among the following most represented. In most countries, the percentage of women deep tech founders among all founders is concentrated between 10% to 20% with the average at 17%.
Funding remains a significant challenge
According to the findings of the study, women face significant funding challenges compared with their male counterparts. On average, deep tech start-ups with at least one woman founder receive less total funding, less funding per round, and smaller first rounds. Women-founded deep tech startups receive significantly less funding compared to those founded by men. At the seed stage, women-led startups secure only 15% of funding, while men-led startups take the remaining 85%. For early and late-stage venture capital, women-founded startups receive just 11% of the total investment, with 89% going to men-led companies. Women also face barriers to entering deep tech compared with other fields.
The report also indicates that women in deep tech may face barriers to accessing private investment and are more likely to receive a first round from public sources. Women deep tech start-ups not only receive a lower first valuation than their men counterparts, but they continue to receive lower valuations throughout their start-ups’ growth cycle and are less likely to reach a EUR 20M valuation.
The only positive trend in funding is that deep tech start-ups with women in their founding teams receive their first funding faster than start-ups with all-men founding teams.
In this context, the EIT and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities have launched the
Supernovas programme
, bringing more women into the world of entrepreneurship and investment as well as supporting women already in it, facilitating women’s engagement in the early-stage investment industry, and igniting growth for women business angels and VC investors.
During the INNOVEIT event, the Supernovas
Data Room
is also presented – a platform showcasing women-led start-ups in high and deep tech entrepreneurship across all EIT Knowledge Communities: EIT Climate-KIC, EIT Culture & Creativity, EIT Digital, EIT Food, EIT Health, EIT InnoEnergy, EIT Manufacturing, EIT RawMaterials and EIT Urban Mobility. The platform also gives investors, corporates, journalists, publishers and other interested parties access to data about these start-ups.

The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) has opened a new Community Hub in Slovakia, connecting local innovators, entrepreneurs and partners to Europe’s largest innovation network. The hub will act as a one-stop shop for local talent to access EIT opportunities, strengthening links between business, education and research.
The launch took place at Kulturpark in Košice, bringing together public officials, business leaders, startups and innovators. The programme featured keynote speeches, panel discussions and networking with EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs).
For me, this hub is first and foremost about people. It means that a young founder in Košice, a researcher in Bratislava, or a student with a bold idea can now more easily find support and partners across Europe. I believe this is how Slovakia can make its mark – by opening doors for our talent and letting their work speak for itself
Ján Oravec, member of the EIT’s Governing Board
The new hub will serve as a central platform for entrepreneurs, researchers, students and businesses to connect with the EIT’s wide range of programmes – from education and skills development to business creation and innovation support.
Supporting Slovakia’s Innovation Potential
The hub is part of the EIT
Regional Innovation Scheme
, which aims to bridge Europe’s innovation divide by boosting competitiveness and supporting sustainable economic growth in regions with high innovation potential. Through this new presence, the EIT Community will increase its collaboration with Slovak partners, provide innovators with access to EU-wide opportunities, and strengthen policy engagement at the local level.
Results 2021–2024
Between 2021 and 2024, Slovakia secured €8.7 million in EIT funding. With this support, the EIT  backed 78 ventures, involved 7 675 participants in training, and helped to launch 11 innovations. Looking ahead, Slovakia has the chance to expand its role by deepening ties with KICs and mobilising national stakeholders, strengthening its place in Europe’s innovation landscape.

YEAR: 2025
The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) Governing Board has released its updated vision outlining concrete steps to boost Europe’s competitiveness through innovation in the next EU long-term budget (Multiannual Financial Framework) running from 2028 to 2034.
At the heart of the EIT model is a unique ecosystem approach that brings together business, education, and research to power collaborative innovation across Europe.  A key highlight of the updated vision is the proposed Knowledge and Innovation Community (KIC) Model, which sets out seven principles for high-performing KICs, including streamlined governance and operations, stronger industry leadership, and financial sustainability from the outset.
With this updated vision, we reaffirm the EIT’s unique role in fostering collaboration in innovation across Europe. The new KIC Model is built on 15 years of experience, showing that focused, agile, and industry-engaged partnerships are key to delivering impact. We are ready to work with all partners to ensure that innovation drives Europe’s competitiveness and reaches every region
Stefan Dobrev, Chair of the EIT Governing Board
The EIT is the EU’s key instrument for putting the knowledge triangle – higher education, research and innovation, and business – into practice to turn ideas into innovation. The Governing Board proposes a set of reforms to strengthen the EIT’s role as a pan-European ecosystem facilitator and better guide innovators to the right EU support. It
also proposes ways to improve how different EU innovation tools work together:
a common innovation framework connecting EU instruments from idea to scale-up;
simplified and harmonised processes to ease access for innovators;
stronger synergies in talent development, policy implementation and investment.
The updated Vision reaffirms the two strategic objectives at the core of the EIT’s future role: (1) closing the innovation gap across Europe – particularly in widening countries through initiatives like the EIT Regional Innovation Booster – and (2) closing the skills gap to deliver the talent needed for Europe’s competitiveness.
The vision proposes to position the EIT AS a key enabler for key priorities of the European Commission such as the recently adopted Union of Skills and the Startup and Scaleup Strategy, and supports the Clean Industrial Deal through enhanced innovation and skills development.
In response to areas with high future innovation potential, the EIT proposes security and resilience as well as AI and Robotics as two potential themes for future KICs, among others. This reflects the EU’s strategic priorities for security and technological leadership as described in the Competitiveness Compass.
The vision reaffirms the EIT as a strategic partner to the European Innovation Council (EIC), leveraging its broad network to channel early-stage ventures into the innovation pipeline, extending the reach of EU tools into underrepresented regions, and equipping innovators with the skills and industrial connections needed for scaling.
These proposals position the EIT – thanks to its unique mix of partnerships, expertise, and shared funding – as a key driver of EU competitiveness and a force for a more connected, inclusive, and results-focused European innovation landscape.
Since 2008, the EIT has supported over 9,900 companies, powered the launch of more than 2,400 new products and services, and helped raise nearly €10 billion in external funding. Its education initiatives have trained over 1.3 million learners in innovation, entrepreneurship, and deep tech across Europe.

YEAR: 2025
Localised climate disasters are now so frequent that authorities struggle to respond in time. A key reason is the lack of effective climate risk assessments and monitoring, with municipalities still relying on fragmented data, outdated models, and reactive systems. Climate KIC is helping address this challenge.
The case for stronger local climate services
In a 2023 survey of 97 European regions,
70 reported
a lack of access to climate data and scientific information as one of their main barriers to effective adaptation. In other words, local actors are expected to bear the brunt of climate risks, but without the tools to help prevent and mitigate their impacts.
That’s where climate services based on
Earth observation
– the provision and use of climate and geospatial data, information and knowledge to assist decision-making – can help address multiple climate change risks, from biodiversity loss and land management to social and political issues affecting communities’ resilience.
Private and public sectors: what role for climate services?
As these services and digital tools are mostly developed in the private sector, the role of innovation procurement becomes central to ensure innovative solutions are matched to local needs. To guarantee timeliness and relevance, public authorities are increasingly turning to pre-commercial procurement, where public buyers define the problems they need to be solved, and several technology providers work on new ideas in parallel to co-develop the most promising solutions in close collaboration with public authorities.
This helps define climate services that are not only technically advanced, but grounded in real-world use cases and ready to support adaptation where it matters most. Through projects like
PROTECT
and
PCP WISE
, Climate KIC has helped establish a community of over 200 public buyers and suppliers across marine and coastal environments, energy and utilities, sustainable urban communities, agriculture and forestry, and civil security.
Insights from the field
To understand local challenges and help define more targeted climate service solutions, Climate KIC led a series of workshops in five European regions: Lemvig (Denmark), Helsinki (Finland), Grenspark Kalmthoutse Heide (Belgium/Netherlands), Catalonia (Spain), and Bratislava (Slovakia). The workshops, part of the PCP WISE project, brought together 92 farmers, civil servants, water agencies, meteorological institutes, and emergency responders, surfacing four key barriers:
Data fragmentation and accessibility
. Many participants described a landscape of scattered datasets, siloed systems, and limited interoperability. In Bratislava, emergency responders operate within systems that still rely on manual communication, reflecting broader gaps in automated infrastructure. In Helsinki, concerns around data sensitivity limit public access to critical information such as detailed flood maps. In Catalonia, groundwater consumption remains largely untracked, with monitoring systems often underdeveloped or fragmented across institutions.
Gaps in monitoring and forecasting
. Regions highlighted missing or insufficient data on soil moisture, groundwater, and evaporation patterns, critical for agriculture and flood prediction. Catalan stakeholders noted that while lagoon monitoring exists, it needs to be expanded region-wide. In Lemvig, participants emphasised the lack of predictive models that integrate rainfall, fjord levels, and electricity prices to manage water pumping during flood events.
Usability and trust
. Even when data is available, it’s often not usable. Participants in Catalonia spoke of ‘black boxes’ of information – datasets that are technically open, but practically inaccessible due to poor formatting or lack of metadata. In
Grenspark Kalmthoutse Heide
, differences in reference values between Belgium and the Netherlands mean that height data must be manually adjusted, complicating cross-border collaboration.
Policy disconnects
. Local actors frequently cited a disconnect between national strategies and local implementation. In Bratislava, overlapping plans and unclear responsibilities hinder action. In Lemvig, Natura 2000 protections limit water management options, even as subsidence and rising groundwater threaten infrastructure. Most regions called for tools to help translate policy into practice.
Innovations grounded in local needs
By holding structured dialogues that surface real needs and priorities, Climate KIC is helping guide the innovations catalysed by PCP WISE towards community-led solutions. Rather than starting with technology, the process begins by identifying the issues and priorities. The resulting insights helped the local authorities and groups define a set of ideal prototypes and climate services that reflected their lived experience:
In
Grenspark Kalmthoutse Heide
, a fire risk dashboard that works across borders;
In
Catalonia
, tools that integrate subterranean water flows with coastal monitoring;
In
Lemvig
, a satellite-based app that informs farmers where streams are overflowing;
In
Bratislava
, automated alert systems and clearer data ownership;
In
Helsinki
, tools that quantify the impact of nature-based solutions on urban flooding.

YEAR: 2025
EIT Digital and the
Hellenic Centre for Defence Innovation
(HCDI) signed a Memorandum of Understanding in Thessaloniki, marking a significant step toward further developing, internationalizing, and empowering Greek startups in the dual-use technology sector.
The agreement establishes a broad framework for collaboration focused on accelerating the growth of Greece's innovation ecosystem and integrating it into European and global markets.
We are proud to announce our collaboration with HCDI and are confident that the jointly launched National Dual-Use Technology Accelerator will be a cornerstone in securing Europe's future. By fostering collaboration between industries, academia, and startups, Europe is well-positioned to become a global leader in secure, ethical, and innovative dual-use solutions
Federico Menna, CEO of EIT Digital
A central element of this partnership is the launch of the National Dual-Use Technology Accelerator, an initiative designed to bolster Europe’s capabilities in technologies that serve both civilian and defence applications.
The programme will foster cross-sector collaboration by bringing together industry, academia, and startups to develop innovative solutions for complex technological challenges.
The partnership also includes concerted efforts to raise awareness and outreach through co-hosted information days, webinars, and joint participation in events aimed at promoting opportunities for Greek companies. To support startup and SME growth, the organisations will provide access to HCDI innovation processes and EIT Digital’s Growth Services, facilitating funding, commercial partnerships, and market entry.
Strategic outreach initiatives will involve co-hosting high-impact events and facilitating delegations to key allied markets such as the U.S., UK, Nordics, and Indo-Pacific, helping Greek companies expand their international presence. Additionally, the collaboration will focus on technology transfer, strengthening ties between R&D centres, universities, and industry to support spinouts and intellectual property commercialization.
EIT Digital operates Europe's largest deep tech innovation ecosystem and plays a vital role in connecting local and regional excellence with the broader European technology and innovation landscape. By linking Greece's entrepreneurial talent to EIT Digital's EU-wide network, we can accelerate growth, attract international investment, and ensure that local breakthroughs contribute to Europe's digital leadership and technological sovereignty
Federico Menna, CEO of EIT Digital
The initiative aligns with broader European goals of achieving greater technological independence and strategic autonomy. By developing dual-use technologies within a framework that emphasizes security and ethics, the partnership seeks to reduce external dependencies while promoting values-based innovation. The success of this collaboration may serve as a model for future cross-sector partnerships in other strategic technology areas across Europe.
