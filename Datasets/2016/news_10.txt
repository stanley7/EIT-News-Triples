Healthcare innovators looking to find development support or partners with expertise, investors looking for bright ideas, and others seeking to bring healthcare innovations to market, will have a unique opportunity to meet their matches at the 1-3 February EIT Health Matchmaking event in Uppsala, Sweden.
Registration is now open for the event, which is expected to include about 300 participants. Anyone seeking to make matches is encouraged to sign up with a special register that lets partners explain details about their ideas or business plans, so that other potential partners can find them and join in their ventures.
The gathering is expected to generate hundreds of one-to-one meetings that can lead to fruitful partnerships. As it is organised by EIT Health, one of the largest healthcare initiatives in the world, with a special focus on innovation, this is truly an unparalleled opportunity.
Register now, to explain the kinds of partners you are looking for, and to view the details from other participants. You can start making connections before the meeting begins, to ensure productive one-to-ones in Uppsala.
You can find out more, and register
at the event’s website (B2Match)
