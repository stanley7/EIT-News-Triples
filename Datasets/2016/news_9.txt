Food Waste company Entomics, and bio-based construction material inventor Adaptavate are the winners of London Climate Innovation Challenge.
Both won £20,000 at the event, held on 6 December, as part of an open innovation process looking to solve waste problems facing London.
At the event, businesses pitched their food waste and building materials recycling ideas to London Waste And Recycling Board (LWARB) and the Greater London authority.
LWARB
LWARB, who are tasked with driving the development of the circular economy in London, used the event to look for start-ups and ideas to play a part in the process.
Ectomics
Food waste winners Entomics are using insect larvae to convert food waste into aquaculture feed and organic fertiliser.
Adaptavate
Second winner Adaptavate’s Breathaboard are an alternative to gypsum plasterboard, using a crop by-product that is completely compostable at the end of its life, reducing the growing issue of plasterboard waste in the construction sector.
Other competing teams
Twelve other businesses including BioBump, ToastAle, Topolytics, Swiftcomply and Loophub, made it through a competitive first round to pitch at the event.
