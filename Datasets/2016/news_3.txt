Flue Gas Recovery Sweden
(FGRS), start-up supported by EIT InnoEnergy offering a unique technical solution for recovering energy from exhaust gases, has been granted 1,8 MSEK (approx. 185 K€) by the Swedish Energy Agency as part of the programme “Verification of new energy innovations”. This programme focuses on innovations that can help increase the supply of renewable energy or energy efficiency, while demonstrating a clear customer benefits, good business potential and good prospects for reaching a large-scale application.
The grant will support the implementation of three pilot systems during the year 2017 to perform further verifications and validations of the company’s Energy Turbo FGR®. The Energy Turbo FGR® is a state of the art solution that recovers both sensible and latent heat energy in the gas by the use of heat exchangers and active cooling. The efforts are expected to further increase product efficiency and reduce soot emissions from existing heating systems, with the ultimate goal to further prepare its commercial phase. The first pilot installation will take place in Gothenburg in cooperation with
High Tech Solutions Byggvärme
in Lidköping, Sweden.
