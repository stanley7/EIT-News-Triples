It is always a pleasure to see committed and bright innovators come together under the same roof and the EIT is proud to have brought together such participants in Copenhagen on 25 and 26 June.
What has the EIT achieved to date? Most importantly, how was this achieved?
These were the key questions addressed at the EIT Conference on ‘Good Practices and Learnings’, which took place at Copenhagen Business School under the auspices of the Danish Presidency.
Within the framework of a wider discussion on the future of innovation policies and the integration of the knowledge triangle (business, research, higher education), the EIT was able to showcase its first achievements and increase understanding on how it can help advance innovation in Europe.
