The University of the Aegean brought together students, researchers, and innovators at the
EIT Digital Summer School on Maritime Informatics and Robotics
.
Marine robotics is rapidly transforming the way we understand and interact with the oceans. From deep-sea and polar exploration to environmental monitoring, shipping, and oceanographic research, autonomous marine systems are opening possibilities once thought unreachable. These technologies can remain at sea for months, recording data, collecting samples, and even transporting goods in greener, safer ways. Yet, the ocean remains one of the most hostile environments for robotics

its challenges more akin to outer space than to land or air.
Classes were hosted at the University of the Aegean in a building with its own rich history: Greece’s very first high school, founded in 1834. True to EIT Digital’s open and practical spirit, students didn’t need a background in robotics to take part. From day one, they were introduced to coding and guided step by step

by professors and volunteers alike

through building their own autonomous boats.
Alongside lectures and hands-on projects, participants also engaged with the IEEE Symposium on Maritime Informatics and Robotics, a two-day event featuring leading-edge research, panels, and the Aegean Ro-Boat Race.
The integration of this international symposium with the Summer School not only showcased cutting-edge technologies in AI, data systems, and robotics, but also highlighted the collaborative spirit driving Europe’s maritime innovation forward.
Amid this vibrant backdrop of learning and competition, we sat down with Professor Dimitris Zissis of the University of the Aegean to discuss the long-term vision for Syros as a hub of maritime innovation, the role of EIT Digital in shaping its future, and the next milestones on the horizon.
Our long-term vision is to establish Syros as a reference point for maritime innovation in Europe. We want the island to become a place where academia, industry, and startups come together to push the boundaries of maritime informatics, robotics, and sustainability. The idea is to create a living lab environment

one that doesn’t just attract talent but also nurtures entrepreneurship and anchors a dynamic blue economy ecosystem in the Aegean

Why did you choose the maritime sector as the focus of this hub, and what sub-sectors are you targeting?
The choice was quite natural. Greece has a profound historical and strategic connection to the sea, but beyond tradition, the maritime sector is at a pivotal moment. Technological advances can dramatically improve safety, efficiency, and environmental performance. This is why we’re concentrating on three main areas. First, smart shipping and maritime informatics, which can make operations safer and more efficient. Second, autonomous surface vessels and maritime robotics, because automation is set to transform how we operate at sea. And third, ocean data systems combined with artificial intelligence, which will enable us to analyze and manage vast amounts of maritime data in new and impactful ways.
How has your collaboration with EIT Digital contributed to the development of this project so far?
EIT Digital has been instrumental in shaping our vision. Through the Summer School, for instance, we’ve been able to build capacity, attract international students, and test educational formats that bridge academic research with real-world maritime challenges. The collaboration has also given the initiative significant visibility, helping us connect with European innovators, researchers, and policy thinkers. Most recently, our participation in the
EIT Digital Master School in Autonomous Systems
(as part of the
SPECTRO
project) has been a major step forward. It strengthens our academic programs and allows us to train the next generation of engineers and researchers in fields directly aligned with our innovation agenda in maritime robotics and informatics.
Which EIT Digital programs or support mechanisms have been most valuable in shaping your innovation ecosystem?
Two elements stand out. The Summer School has been essential in grounding our initiative in high-quality education and hands-on experimentation. It has given students the chance to work on practical challenges and experience innovation in action. Equally important has been the access to the broader EIT Digital ecosystem. The networks and partnerships we’ve been able to build through this connection would have been extremely difficult to establish on our own.
How do you see EIT Digital playing a role in the next steps of this initiative?
We view EIT Digital as a strategic partner in our next phase. One priority is scaling up the Summer School and transforming it into a flagship European blue tech academy. We are also working towards deploying a Center of Excellence in Smart Shipping, in collaboration with EIT, which will solidify our leadership in the field. Another key goal is to support the launch of deep tech startups that will emerge from the hub, ensuring that innovation is not only researched but also commercialized. Finally, EIT Digital can play an important role in facilitating policy dialogue and in showcasing our hub as a case study for how regional innovation can drive sectoral transformation.
