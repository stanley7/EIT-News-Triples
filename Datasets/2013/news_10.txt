Conference Report now available online!
I am pleased to present the report on the EIT Conference, ‘Fostering Innovation and Strengthening Synergies within the EU’, held in Dublin on 29 and 30 April 2013 under the auspices of the Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union. This event attracted over 280 participants and about 100 on live stream online. As the EIT strives to become a reference Institute for the fostering of entrepreneurial innovation in Europe, it becomes increasingly important to learn from, and share experiences with, interested stakeholders.The Conference in Dublin was a key opportunity to do so ahead of the launch of the new call for Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs) the EIT is preparing to launch in 2014.
Presented by the three current KICs Chairmen and CEOs, questions were addressed included how best to integrate the knowledge triangle; what changes the EIT’s KIC brings to the European landscape through excellent partnerships, funding models and project portfolio; how outputs and inputs are measured; which bottom-up engagements are possible with regions, other national and EU instruments; and how synergies can be created and further explore.
