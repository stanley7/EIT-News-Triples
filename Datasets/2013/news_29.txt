EIT Food is proud to announce the winner of the 2025 ReGrow.UA Request for Proposal: the
My Syla
Charitable Foundation.
The organisation will receive €40,000 in funding to implement its innovative project titled “National Platform for Soil and Water Contaminant Intelligence.”
The project aims to support Ukraine’s agricultural recovery by piloting the country’s first open-access environmental data platform for mapping and mitigating war-related soil and water contamination. The platform will provide farmers, cooperatives, and local authorities with interactive maps and evidence-based recommendations on land use, safe cultivation, and remediation options.
The initiative will be implemented by My Syla in close collaboration with the newly launched Centre of Excellence for Life Sciences, Agriculture, and Bioingenuity (CE-LAB). This cooperation brings together top Ukrainian institutions, such as the National University of Life and Environmental Sciences (NUBiP) and the National Academy of Agrarian Sciences, whose shared expertise ensures the project’s scientific rigour and real-world impact for Ukrainian farmers.
Over a six-month pilot phase, the project will:
Aggregate and analyse up to 100 soil and 50 water samples per month from war-affected regions;
Launch a user-friendly prototype platform featuring GIS-based maps and decision-support tools;
Train participants, including farmers and agronomists, in using the platform and interpreting data;
Engage agri-tech start-ups to explore future services based on the platform's environmental intelligence.
By focusing on data-driven recovery, the project will empower farmers to make informed decisions about land use, apply for government support, and safely resume food production on previously contaminated lands.
The platform is designed as a scalable solution, with the potential to evolve into a national-level agricultural data infrastructure
–
a future “digital backbone” for Ukraine’s green recovery.
