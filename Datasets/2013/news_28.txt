Climate KIC, through the
Regional Resilience Journey
, helps regions going through systemic transformation – supporting communities to co-design adaptation strategies that are inclusive, rooted in place, and aligned across governance levels.
Regions in Europe are increasingly exposed to climate extremes – from devastating floods and droughts to rising sea levels and biodiversity collapse. However, adaptation efforts are often reactive and lack the cohesion needed to tackle the systemic nature of the climate crisis. At Climate KIC, we’re working to change that.
At the centre of this shift is
ARCADIA
: a flagship Horizon Europe project that brings together eight European regions to embed nature-based solutions into the heart of climate adaptation planning. While ARCADIA is leading this shift, its principles are reflected in other Climate KIC-supported projects, such as
DesirMED
and
NBRACER
. Together, they are turning the Regional Resilience Journey from a framework into practical outcomes.
Redefining adaptation: ARCADIA’s systemic approach
What distinguishes ARCADIA is how nature-based solutions are positioned within wider systems of governance, land use, finance, and public behaviour. Across the project’s network of model and fellow regions,
Co-Innovation Labs
serve as catalysts for experimentation, bringing together local authorities, researchers, landowners, and citizens to co-create context-specific solutions.
As the European Commission stated, Nature-based Solutions are inspired and supported by nature, which are cost-effective, simultaneously provide environmental, social and economic benefits and help build resilience. Such solutions bring more, and more diverse, nature and natural features and processes into cities, landscapes and seascapes, through locally adapted, resource-efficient and systemic interventions.
In
Emilia-Romagna
, for instance, the aftermath of recent floods has led to a renewed focus on the role of mountainous areas in regional safety. Here, ARCADIA is supporting municipal authorities to explore how sustainable management of upland ecosystems can reduce downstream risk and anchor wider resilience planning.
Meanwhile, in
Lower Austria
, where over half the municipalities participate in climate adaptation networks, ARCADIA is helping integrate nature-based solutions into flood risk strategies and regional policies through three collaborative labs that bridge research, policy and practice.
ARCADIA’s partners in Denmark’s
Funen
region are tackling one of the project’s most complex challenges: how to align nature-based water management across five municipalities and a shared fjord ecosystem. By building a ‘Water Cycle Master Plan’ and running labs on sustainable drainage, cross-sector collaboration, and catchment restoration, the region is pioneering governance models that are as systemic as the hydrological cycles they aim to influence.
Across the border in southern Sweden, ARCADIA’s focus has turned to the transitional zones between rural and urban – where land pressures, biodiversity loss, and flood risks converge. In the
Skåne
region, cities like Malmö, Helsingborg and Lund are working with local landowners and researchers to create blue-green corridors that both manage water and support ecosystems. These networks are designed to mitigate impact while integrating natural diversity into suburban and agricultural life.
What ties these efforts together is a shared commitment to adaptation grounded in place but connected across geographies. Knowledge shared between model and fellow regions has enabled places like
Zagreb
, where brownfield regeneration is addressing urban heat and flooding, to build on the experience of more advanced sites.
In Romania’s
Centru
region, the presence of Natura 2000 sites has opened a pathway to align biodiversity protection with energy efficiency and land-use reform. A recent workshop showed the growing potential of regional collaboration:
It was a great starting point for our region and stakeholders to get familiar with the Scorecard. The workshop was very well received by the 37 participants. The group-based format worked well, and even when scores varied significantly between stakeholders, it was a good opportunity to foster engagement and dialogue

Beyond ARCADIA: A broader ecosystem of resilience
While ARCADIA provides an example of the Regional Resilience Journey in action, its principles resonate across other parts of Climate KIC’s adaptation portfolio. In the Mediterranean, DesirMED is piloting constructed wetlands for rural wastewater treatment in Greece, and empowering Croatian students to design school gardens grounded in permaculture principles. These initiatives combine practical impact with community learning – helping to shift mindsets as well as systems.
In Denmark’s Central Region, the NBRACER project is reimagining wastewater infrastructure by integrating nature-based solutions into ageing grey systems. A pilot in Lemvig is demonstrating how climate-resilient design can reduce costs and environmental impact, while acting as a platform for innovation among SMEs. Meanwhile, in the Dutch province of Fryslân, regional stakeholders have come together to chart the steps needed to turn bold nature-based visions into implementable roadmaps. Through the identification of barriers, enablers and governance gaps, the project is helping the region move from principles to practice.
These efforts strengthen the argument that climate resilience cannot be achieved through isolated projects or top-down mandates, but through building new relationships between people and ecosystems, government and community, and present needs and future risks.
