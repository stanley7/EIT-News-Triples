In Tanzania’s rural heartlands, climate change is rewriting the rules of farming.
For generations, smallholder farmers like William Karatibu relied on traditional knowledge to navigate the rhythms of nature. But with erratic rainfall, blistering heatwaves, and shifting seasons, those methods no longer work
–
and livelihoods are at risk. Failed harvests turned into food insecurity and shrinking incomes, until he discovered a different way forward.
That turning point came through Rada360, a Tanzanian agri-tech startup using AI and satellite data to deliver hyperlocal weather forecasts and crop insights straight to farmers’ phones. With Rada360’s tools, Karatibu began planting at optimal times, adjusting fertilisers based on soil data, and protecting crops before droughts or pests struck. His yields rebounded. So did his confidence.
Backing Local Solutions with Global Impact
Rada360 is one of four ventures supported by the Adaptation Innovation Cluster, a Climate KIC programme developed in partnership with SmartLab and funded by Irish Aid. The initiative backs locally led, tech-driven solutions to climate challenges
–
providing early-stage financing, technical support, and pilot opportunities for ventures serving rural communities.
Tanzania faces a widening data gap in the face of climate volatility. More than 70% of farmers operate on a smallholder basis, yet few have access to reliable weather data or climate-smart tools. That’s where Climate KIC is stepping in
–
not only to close the information divide but to build a foundation for long-term resilience.
Through the Cluster, startups like Rada360 are testing and scaling innovations such as precision agriculture, resilient seed systems, and sustainable protein production. These ventures don’t just help farmers adapt
–
they also create jobs, stimulate local economies, and reduce systemic vulnerability to climate shocks.
AI with Ethics and Equity at the Core
Supporting innovation also means supporting responsibility. As AI becomes an enabler of climate adaptation, Climate KIC is prioritising ethical, inclusive deployment
–
partnering with initiatives like the Training Programme for AI-Driven Climate Change Solutions (run with Omdena) to build skills and awareness among Tanzanian youth, farmers, and developers.
In Tanzania, AI isn’t driven by big corporations
–
it’s built from the ground up by young innovators and grassroots communities. With the right tools and support, they can transform how we adapt to climate change
