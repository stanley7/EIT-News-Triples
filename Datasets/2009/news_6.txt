EIT Entrepreneurship Seminar confirms key role of entrepreneurship in KICs
The EIT Entrepreneurship Seminar, held on 6-7 May in Wroclaw, Poland, focused on the central role entrepreneurship is going to play within the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) and its Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs). Speakers highlighted the need for a new entrepreneurial culture in Europe, saying the KICs had the potential to bring about a new generation of entrepreneurs and thus inject a boost into European innovation.
Daria Golebiowska-Tataj, member of the EIT Governing Board's Executive Committee and organiser of the seminar, stressed the importance of entrepreneurship for the success of the EIT: "innovative European entrepreneurs are a major output of every KIC". This view was very much shared by panellists and speakers, who insisted that heterogeneity and co-location were crucial if the KICs were to create a fertile breeding ground for entrepreneurship.
