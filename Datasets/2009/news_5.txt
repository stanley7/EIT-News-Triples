INFO DAY provides KIC proposers with answers to remaining questions
The EIT's Info Day, organised on 8 May in Wroclaw (Poland), was the occasion for potential KIC proposers to clarify remaining questions related to the call for Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs).
More than 165 participants from Europe and beyond met with the Executive Committee of the EIT Governing Board (Martin Schuurmans (Chairman), Giovanni Colombo, Anders Flodström, Daria Golebiowska-Tataj, and Yrjö Neuvo) to get a comprehensive run-through of the requirements and selection criteria for the first two to three KICs, which are to be designated by the end of 2009.
