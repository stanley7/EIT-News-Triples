2009 has been very busy for the EIT in the run-up to the call for proposals for the first Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs). The Board notably organized three thematic seminars in order to discuss with potential KIC proposers the focus of the three themes for the first KICs and their synergies with each other.
The first two to three KICs will be selected from 3 themes: future information and communication society, sustainable energy and climate change mitigation and adaptation (Note: although avenues for cross-fertilisation exist between the different themes, each KIC must principally address one of these three themes). The three seminars, hosted in Budapest, Vienna and Madrid respectively, gave interested parties from each priority area the opportunity to engage in an open dialogue with members of the EIT Governing Board.
Each seminar generated much interest from across Europe and beyond, with representatives from business, entrepreneurship, government, higher education, research and technology transfer â€“ reflecting the EIT's objective of bringing together all parts of the innovation web.
The seminars not only generated fruitful discussions, but also provided interested parties with an opportunity for networking and partnering activities in view of the formation of future KICs.
