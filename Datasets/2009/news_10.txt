The EIT has today released the selection criteria for the first Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs).
While the official publication of the call for proposals is expected in April, the EIT Governing Board already wants to provide interested parties with timely and comprehensive information on the main requirements that applicants are expected to fulfil in their KIC proposals. "We are aware of timing constraints. This is why we want to be as transparent as possible and provide potential applicants with clear guidance on what the EIT expects from a KIC" says EIT Chairman Dr. Martin Schuurmans.
KIC Selection Criteria
The detailed call for proposals is expected to be published in the Official Journal of the European Union in early April and will equally be available through the EIT website.
The
EIT presentation
will provide background information on the concepts referred to in the selection criteria.
