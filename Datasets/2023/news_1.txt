EIT Alumni Nodes Launch and EIT Alumni CONNECT 2023 took place in Barcelona, Spain, on November 23-24, 2023. The groundbreaking EIT Alumni Nodes initiative was launched at the EIT Urban Mobility CLC South offices (Torre Glòries).
This initiative aims to provide physical spaces for EIT Alumni innovators and entrepreneurs, serving as incubators for collaboration and innovation.
EIT Alumni is an interdisciplinary and multicultural network of graduates of all EIT's Knowledge Innovation Communities who share a vision of a more sustainable Europe.
The EIT Alumni Nodes project, unveiled within the dynamic realm of the European Institute of Innovation & Technology, involves eight skilled Project Officers representing distinct EIT KIC Alumni communities. These Nodes complement Co-Location Centres (CLCs) of Knowledge and Innovation Communities, fostering collaboration across diverse fields and bridging critical gaps in start-up support.
The launch event at Torre Glòries included insightful discussions on the space's utility, emphasising the project's commitment to a thriving community of changemakers. The reception event at AmoVino in Barcelona's city center followed the launch, providing a platform for networking and celebrating the venture's success with over 70 participants.
The EIT Alumni Nodes project envisions more Nodes being established in the coming years, fostering collaboration and empowering the EIT Alumni community across various fields.
Meanwhile, at Casa Rius in Barcelona, the EIT Alumni CONNECT 2023 event brought together change agents, entrepreneurs, and representatives from EIT Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs)
for a day of networking and discussions. The event featured speakers, including CEOs and founders, discussing education, innovation, and business creation.
Keynote speaker Zaki Milhem emphasised the power of deep tech for sustainable and inclusive innovation. A panel discussion on urban mobility highlighted the importance of creating livable and sustainable cities.
