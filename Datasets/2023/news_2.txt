In 2021, Fondazione Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) and EIT Digital joined forces to boost the sponsor program of the
EIT Digital
Master School. As part of Italy's commitment to future development, Fondazione CDP dedicated EUR 300,000 to fund around twenty scholarships, each worth EUR 15,000. These scholarships covered full tuition fees at two universities within the EIT Digital Master School network, along with a living allowance.
Twenty Italian students took advantage of the opportunity, which ended up having a deeply positive impact on their academic and professional opportunities.
For Gianluca Pasolini, the CDP scholarship played a pivotal role in his journey, offering him financial support and the confidence that others believed in his potential. This support enabled him to fully immerse himself in his studies and extracurricular activities, pushing his limits and maximizing his educational experience.
Gianluca's time at the EIT Digital Master School was enriched by the diverse networking opportunities and the exchange of ideas with students and professionals from various fields. While adapting to different teaching styles posed initial challenges, it ultimately bolstered his adaptability in various academic environments.
His academic path began with the study of Cybersecurity. The first year at the University of Trento in Italy provided him with an in-depth understanding of the theoretical aspects of cybersecurity. The following year at EURECOM in France allowed Gianluca to delve into specialized topics and engage in projects with real-world implications. Supplementing his formal education, a summer school experience in Bratislava and an internship in Luxembourg provided him with practical insights and application opportunities in the consulting sector.
