Creating pan-European market for innovations
Workshops and panel discussions were on topics such as how to bring more innovations to the market, how to address key societal and environmental issues, how to bring public and private investors closer together, how to enable our startups to scale up in EU, and finally how to create a pan-European market for innovators, entrepreneurs and investors.
The event emphasised the potential in collaboration for solving major challenges like tech transfer, climate change, gender inequality, and scaling-up of start-ups.
Keeping inclusion and sustainability in mind
Speeches, panel discussions and workshops at the event were organised with an eye on furthering innovation and collaboration, while keeping inclusion and sustainability in mind.
