Gerard de Nazelle, EIT Director, has decided to leave the EIT as of 1 September 2010 due to personal reasons. He wishes the EIT and the KICs success for the future.
The EIT Governing Board would like to thank Mr de Nazelle for his contribution to the EIT. Dr. Ronald de Bruin (EIT Head of Unit for Operations, Strategy & Communication) will assume the position of acting Director until a successor is nominated.
