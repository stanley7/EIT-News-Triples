Dr Martin Schuurmans, Chairman of the EIT's Governing Board, was invited to the 2010 Innovation Summit organised by the Lisbon Council in Brussels on 5 March 2010. The summit with the title "Setting the Right Course for the Barroso II Commission: The Future of EU Innovation Policy in a Changing World" was held at a time where Europe stands at an important crossroads.
From the recent establishment of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) to the arrival of the first full-time Innovation Commissioner, Máire Geogheagan-Quinn, innovation policy is set to take centre stage on the European agenda in coming years. "We do have excellent research, education and business centres but knowledge and ideas sometimes still tend to clog up in dead ends. Here is where we clearly need to do better", Dr Schuurmans highlighted in his speech.
