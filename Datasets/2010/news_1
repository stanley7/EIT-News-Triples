'Excellence for innovation' was the motto of a special day at the EU's pavilion at the Shanghai World EXPO (China) today, dedicated to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT). As one of the European Union's flagship initiatives the EIT attracted representatives from Chinese universities, businesses and public authorities to discuss the importance of innovation in a knowledge economy.
Under the theme 'intelligent Europe' the European Union showcases some of its most important activities at the Shanghai EXPO. Anders Flodström, Vice Chairman of the EIT, explains why the EIT is one of them: "The EIT is a European initiative with a clear international vocation. We want to be world-class in innovation - and you cannot be world class by just looking inward".
Jan Truszczyński, Director General for Education and Culture at the European Commission, stressed the novelty of the EIT as the first European initiative to fully integrate actors from innovation, research and education: "With the EIT's Knowledge and Innovation Communities we want to be pioneers for changing the innovation landscape in Europe. They will be hubs of innovation with attractive conditions for working, studying and doing business".
Organised at the EU-Belgian pavilion, the EIT thematic day gathered participants from Chinese higher education institutions, research centres, businesses and associations in the field of science and technology as well as public authorities. Discussions focused on the role of innovation in a knowledge society and on how innovation can be better promoted, and on the exchange of best practice examples from Europe and China in the areas where the EIT currently operates: climate change, sustainable energy and future information and communication society.
